					<description><![CDATA[Are the new Dynamax Adventures in the Crown Tundra a good addition to Pokemon Sword and Shield? My thoughts on this new legendary experience.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dynamax Adventures are a new type of content added in the <a href="https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/the-crown-tundra/">Crown Tundra DLC</a> for Pokemon Sword and Shield. This system is the only way to capture the returning legendaries, other than the Regis, in the Crown Tundra. With almost 50 legendaries, Dynamax Adventures will take you a while to complete.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Do Dynamax Adventures Work?</h2>



<p>Shortly into the Crown Tundra expansion, you will unlock this new system. Each run will pit you against multiple Pokemon, with a guaranteed legendary at the end. You will have a chance to catch the legendary if you defeat it. However, you can only a capture each legendary once. You will not get the option to capture a legendary you have already captured.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-description.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="706" height="501" src="/wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-description.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9012" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-description.jpg 706w, /wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-description-300x213.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px" /></a></figure>



<p>Rather than bringing in your own Pokemon, your team will check out rental Pokemon with set templates. Each Pokemon you defeat along the way to the last fight can be exchanged for your current rental Pokemon. HP, PP, and statuses all carry over between fights.</p>

</script>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Rental Pokemon</h2>



<p>You will not be able to bring your own Pokemon into Dynamax Adventures. Instead you and your team will be using <a href="https://www.serebii.net/swordshield/dynamaxadventurespokemon.shtml">rental Pokemon templates</a>. There are only a limited number of Pokemon that can be used in this setting. Obtaining them for your run is left up to RNG. These templates ensure that in group play you will not get matched up with someone with a &#8220;bad&#8221; Pokemon. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-rental.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-rental-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9015" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-rental-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-rental-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-rental-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-rental.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Pokemon are rented in Dynamax Adventures</figcaption></figure>



<p>While it is nice to be able to play with Pokemon I would not otherwise use, I wish I could use my Pokemon instead. You catch all these legendaries, but can&#8217;t even use them in this format. Using Pokemon that aren&#8217;t mine makes me feel a bit disconnected from the fights. Most runs end up feeling more like RNG than skill.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Legendary Pokemon as Rewards</h2>



<p>The main rewards from Dynamax Adventures are Legendary Pokemon. Every Legendary is obtainable in the Crown Tundra. It&#8217;s great that these Pokemon have been added, but their use is limited. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-reward.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-reward-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9016" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-reward-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-reward-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-reward-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-reward.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Legendary Pokemon are the main reward from Dynamax Adventures</figcaption></figure>



<p>With so many of them, they feel a lot less exciting to capture than they were originally. Many of these Pokemon used to be at the end of extensive quest chains that culminated in battles with dedicated arenas and music. Instead, now you&#8217;ll be fighting every legendary in the same boring Dynamax Den arena with a slightly remixed version of the boring Dynamax Den music. Overall, the ease of access and the shear number of legendaries you&#8217;ll be capturing remove a lot of the &#8220;legendary&#8221; feeling from them. </p>



<p>They also, generally, cannot be used in competitive battles. There are some events and formats where legendaries can be used. But, for the most part you won&#8217;t be able to bring your new OP Pokemon into ranked fights. Perhaps there is some use for them in the new Galarian Star Tournament. However, by the time you&#8217;ve captured these Pokemon you&#8217;ll already be in the endgame of Sword and Shield, limiting the use of these legendaries. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-vivid-purple-color has-css-opacity has-vivid-purple-background-color has-background"/>



<script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4537180102637521" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dynamax Adventures Additional Rewards</h2>



<p>Completing a Dynamax Adventure will also reward you with the new currency, Dynite Ore. This currency can be spent on a few useful items like Beast Balls, vitamins, and the new <a href="https://www.serebii.net/itemdex/abilitypatch.shtml">Ability Patch</a>. Dynite Ore is a decent reward and the rate you get them from adventures is ok. </p>



<p>In addition to legendaries, Dynamax Aventures are a good way to shiny hunt. Unlike normal Max Raid Battles, the Pokemon in these fights do not gain shields at certain health breakpoints, making the fights pretty quick. It is possible to obtain shiny versions of the legendaries too, but you can only catch one of each. If you are planning on shiny hunting legendaries, you&#8217;ll have to pass on every non-shiny until you get lucky.</p>



<p>Unlike Max Raid Battles, you don&#8217;t get TRs or EXP candies. Despite being a good source of Dynite Ore, once you capture each legendary, you&#8217;ll have very little incentive to continue doing Dynamax Adventures. You can trade your Dynite Ore for Armorite Ore, which can then by converted into Watts at Digging Pa. For more on this process, check out our guide on <a href="/farm-watts-in-isle-of-armor/">Watt Farming</a>. Unfortunately, the exchange rate isn&#8217;t great and if you are targeting Watts specifically; it&#8217;s probably best to just farm the Armorite Ore instead. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Playing With a Team</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Real Players</h3>



<p>Dynamax Adventures encourage playing in a group with other players. Sometimes these fights can be quite difficult with rental Pokemon. Playing with others is the best way to complete these challenges. I&#8217;ve generally had good experiences with the groups I have had. But, Sword and Shield has always had an issue with player interactions. </p>



<p>Other than the few choices you make during your run, you can&#8217;t interact with the other players at all. Pokemon, and Nintendo in general, has always tried to limit the ability of players to be toxic to one another. However, with almost no interaction, the other players in my team might as well be intelligent bots. Even something as simple as an emote system would bring some life into these groups. Though, I&#8217;d probably end up spamming &#8220;Good Job!&#8221; when someone uses another water move into Maractus&#8217;s Storm Drain&#8230;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-path.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-path-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9014" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-path-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-path-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-path-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/dynamax-adventures-path.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Non-Playable Characters</h3>



<p>If you can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t want to play with other real players, the game will match you up with NPCs. Luckily these bots aren&#8217;t as bad as those in Max Raid Battles. They will be using the same rental Pokemon that you have access to, which are mostly decent. However, they still make frustratingly bad decisions, especially when it comes to status moves and two-turn moves. </p>



<p>Playing with NPCs does mean that you get to pick the path. This lets you pick the Pokemon that will be most useful in the final battle. However, you can&#8217;t force them to pick the Pokemon that you capture along the way. Even if those Pokemon would be clearly superior than their current Pokemon, the bots might not pick them. When playing with NPCs, your success is much more reliant on RNG than when playing with other players. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dynamax Adventures Summary</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pros</h3>



<p>Dynamax Adventures are a good addition to Pokemon Sword and Shield. It&#8217;s nice to be able to catch all the legendaries of previous games. Rental Pokemon make you diversify your Pokemon choices, keeping it fresh (for a while). </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cons</h3>



<p>Once you have one of each legendary, there is little reason to continue doing these. Many runs feel that they are in the hands of RNG rather than skill. You are encouraged to play with others, but can&#8217;t interact with them. NPCs still make terrible decisions and can turn a good run into a failure with no mistakes on your part. Catching legendaries in this format does not feel &#8220;legendary.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Learn how to get to the Crown Tundra and start your legendary adventure in Pokemon Sword and Shield's second expansion.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <a href="https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/the-crown-tundra/">Crown Tundra</a> is the second expansion for Pokemon Sword and Shield. It includes a whole new zone to explore south of the original zone. It is full of returning Pokemon from previous games, including legendries. This guide will show you how to get to the Crown Tundra.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Purchase the Crown Tundra Expansion</h2>



<p>The Crown Tundra is paid DLC for Pokemon Sword and Shield. To go to the new area, you will need to buy the expansion. The easiest way to do this is through the Nintendo eShop, but this will require an internet connection. You do not need the paid service, Nintendo Switch Online, to make this purchase. </p>



<p>You can navigate to the purchase page in multiple ways. Opening the Nintendo eShop through the Switch homepage and searching for Pokemon Sword or Pokemon Shield will take you to their respective pages. You can also press the &#8220;+&#8221; button on the icon for Sword or Shield to bring up its menu. Under &#8220;Software Information&#8221; select &#8220;Nintendo eShop.&#8221;</p>



<p>From the main page for the version of the game you own, scroll down to see the DLCs available for purchase. Currently, you cannot buy the Crown Tundra on its own; you will have to purchase the Expansion Pass that also includes<a href="https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/the-isle-of-armor/"> Isle of Armor</a>.</p>



<p>You can also purchase physical copies of the game plus the expansion pass at Nintendo&#8217;s website for both <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/pokemon-sword-and-pokemon-sword-expansion-pass-switch/">Sword </a>and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/pokemon-shield-and-pokemon-shield-expansion-pass-switch/">Shield</a>.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Go to the Wedgehurst Train Station</h2>



<p>Once you have purchased the expansion, you will receive a notification upon loading into the game that you are ready to set off to the Crown Tundra. You will also receive a &#8220;Crown Pass&#8221; key item that allows you to select the new destination at the train station. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/access-crown-tundra-pass.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="706" height="574" src="/wp-content/uploads/access-crown-tundra-pass.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8214" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/access-crown-tundra-pass.jpg 706w, /wp-content/uploads/access-crown-tundra-pass-300x244.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px" /></a></figure>



<p>Similar to the Isle of Armor, you will need to go to the Wedgehurt Train Station. This is the first city that you encountered in the story, just north of Route 01. The train station is on the southern part of the city. Once inside, present you Crown Pass to the ticket NPC and select the Crown Tundra Station. If you haven&#8217;t yet done the opening to Isle of Armor, you will have to catch the slowpoke first. </p>



<p>Upon arriving, you Pokedex will be updated with all of the new Crown Tundra specific Pokemon. Just leave the station and start your legendary adventure!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[G-Max Coalossal can outspeed and OHKO almost anything with this Steam Engine Weakness Policy doubles team for Pokemon Sword &#038; Shield. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This doubles strategy makes use of <a href="https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/coalossal/">Coalossal&#8217;s</a> ability <a href="https://www.serebii.net/abilitydex/steamengine.shtml">Steam Engine</a> ability to give it a huge speed boost while also doubling its Special Attack through <a href="https://www.serebii.net/itemdex/weaknesspolicy.shtml">Weakness Policy</a>, allowing Coalossal to OHKO most Pokemon with its great type coverage. It also sets up G-Max Volcalith to whittle down defensive opponents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">G-Max Coalossal&#8217;s Build</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/coalossal-swsh-doubles-stats.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="927" height="550" src="/wp-content/uploads/coalossal-swsh-doubles-stats.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8979" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/coalossal-swsh-doubles-stats.jpg 927w, /wp-content/uploads/coalossal-swsh-doubles-stats-300x178.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/coalossal-swsh-doubles-stats-768x456.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 927px) 100vw, 927px" /></a></figure>



<p>Coalossal makes up for its terrible speed with great special attack and good bulk. With a base stat of 110 HP, it is a great target to Dynamax since Dynamaxing doubles the Pokemon&#8217;s health. However, it has a 4x weakness to Water, meaning that hard hitting Water moves can still OHKO it.  </p>



<p>Coalossal&#8217;s nature and EV distribution is left a bit up to choice. The most important stats for Coalossal are Special Attack, Speed, and HP. Focusing on Special Attack and Speed give Coalossal the best chance of being able to OHKO a Pokemon before it gets its turn. However, in situations where you won&#8217;t be able to OHKO or the opponent has priority moves, the extra bulk from HP will significantly increase how long Coalossal lives. HP is also a great choice if you expect that your opponent will be able to shut down your Water Enabler (see <a href="#counters">Counters</a>). </p>



<p>You can also min/max a bit with the SpA and Spe values to just perfectly outspeed or OHKO the Pokemon you expect to be up against, allowing you to put more EVs into HP. Since it is tough to account for every possible scenario, especially with the prevalence of speed increases like Max Airstream, I suggest just maxing EVs in SpA and Spe, even if it ends up being a bit overkill.</p>



<p>The moves are chosen to maximize G-Max damage; Coalossal will not be very effective when not G-Maxed, but if you get three G-Max moves off with this build, you are likely doing well.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Water Enabler&#8217;s Build</h2>



<p>To trigger Coalossal&#8217;s Steam Engine and Weakness policy at the same time, you will want to hit it with a water move. There are two good options for water moves to use on your Coalossal &#8211; Aqua Jet and Surf.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/aquajet.shtml">Aqua Jet</a></h3>



<p>The best option to guarantee you outspeed your opponent is Aqua Jet, a <strong>+1 priority</strong> water move. Aqua Jet allows your Water Enabler to bypass speed concerns, opening up a more diverse set of builds, including bulky supports. </p>



<p>Where Aqua Jet will have issues when compared to Surf is against Follow Me and Rage Powder. These moves will redirect your Aqua Jet into the other Pokemon instead of Coalossal. See <a href="#counters">Counters </a>for more on this.</p>



<p>A couple good options to consider for an Aqua Jet Water Enabler:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/azumarill/">Azumarill </a>&#8211; 50 Atk, 100 HP, bulky, Light Screen, Grass absorb</li>



<li><a href="https://serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/clawitzer/">Clawitzer </a>&#8211; 73 Atk, 120 SpA, solid Special Attacker</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-sm/surf.shtml">Surf</a></h3>



<p>Another option instead of Aqua Jet is to bring Surf on a fast Pokemon. Similar to Aqua Jet, you will want this move to hit for very little. The benefit of Surf over Aqua Jet is Surf <strong>hits the entire field</strong>. This ignores one of the major counters to an Aqua Jet setup, Follow Me and Rage Powder. The AoE of Surf also hits opponents, removing their Focus Sashes before Coalossal gets its first hit.</p>



<p>The issue with Surf is that your snabler is more vulnerable to priority moves and fast Pokemon. Whimsicott&#8217;s Trickster priority Tailwind can make many Pokemon faster than your Water Enabler, potentially OHKOing it before it gets Surf off. See <a href="#counters">Counters </a>for more on this.</p>



<p>Some Pokemon to consider as Surf Water Enablers:</p>



<ul id="block-913754ec-e6f8-4707-822f-69a39aecb32b">

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Minimize Damage</h3>



<p>Whether you pick Aqua Jet, Surf, or any other water move, you will want it to hit for as little as possible to avoid dealing unnecessary damage to your Coalossal. This means that you should have a 0 IV (&#8220;No Good&#8221;) in the associated damage stat (Attack for Aqua Jet and Special Attack for Surf). This will keep your Coalossal as healthy as possible and potentially allow it to take a few hits.</p>



<script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4537180102637521" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-vivid-purple-color has-css-opacity has-vivid-purple-background-color has-background"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Strategy: Attack Your Coalossal With Water</h2>



<p>In an ideal opening turn (with no counters), G-Max your Coalossal and aim to OHKO any threats to Coalossal, like water types. If you don&#8217;t need to pick a specific move to guarantee a kill, try to set up G-Max Volcalith as soon as possible. Volcalith&#8217;s 1/6 health per turn to both opponents adds up quickly and counters any Focus Sash they may have.</p>



<p>With your Water Enabler. hit Coalossal with the water ability to trigger Steam Engine and Weakness Policy. Steam Engine will make Coalossal faster than most Pokemon, especially on turn one before they&#8217;ve had much of a chance to setup. Weakness Policy will give a +2 to Coalossal&#8217;s Special Attack, effectively doubling the amount of damage it deals.  </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-vivid-purple-color has-css-opacity has-vivid-purple-background-color has-background"/>



<script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4537180102637521" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4537180102637521" data-ad-slot="5280630734"></ins>

</script>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="counters">G-Max Coalossal Counters</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Focus Sash Water Attacker</h3>



<p>A Focus Sashed Pokemon with a powerful water type move can OHKO Coalossal. Remember that Coalossal takes 4x damage from water.  Coalossal can outspeed almost any Pokemon once Steam Engine is active and G-Max Volcalith will finish off any sashed Pokemon at the end of the turn. However, you won&#8217;t be able to stop a Pokemon with a Focus Sash from hitting Coalossal at least once. </p>



<p>To account for this, you can bring Fake Out on your Water Enabler and try to take out the sashed Pokemon without Weakness Policy. You might consider switching in a Pokemon that resists or absorbs water and bring Coalossal back once the threat is gone. The issue with Focus Sash is that you won&#8217;t know for sure if a Pokemon has one. Pokemon that are likely to have a Focus Sash are hard hitting but low health &#8216;glass cannons&#8217; like Barraskewda.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fake Out</h3>



<p>Fake Out can stop you Water Enabler from activating Coalossal. This will not only stop Weakness Policy on Coalossal, but also block the activation of Steam Engine. Your opponent&#8217;s other Pokemon can potentially take Coalossal down before it gets to do anything. </p>



<p>The best way to deal with a Fake Out starter is to replace one of Coalossal&#8217;s moves with Protect. Use Protect on your first turn and do the combo on the second. Your opponent may go for you Water Enabler though, so a Protect, Fake Out, or a Focus Sash can help get them to the next turn. The issue here is that you&#8217;ll be losing one of your coverage moves on Coalossal, though having Max Guard against other threats is always nice. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-vivid-purple-color has-css-opacity has-vivid-purple-background-color has-background"/>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Water Enabler Counters</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Redirect &#8211; Aqua Jet Counter</h4>



<p>Aqua Jet is a targeted ability. If your opponent uses Follow Me or any other redirect move, Aqua Jet will attack the new target instead of Coalossal. Redirect moves have a higher priority than Aqua Jet, so you won&#8217;t be able to go before it. If you don&#8217;t deal with a redirector, they will likely redirect the next turn as well.</p>



<p>This is very hard to deal with on an Aqua Jet setup. Barraskewda can learn Aqua Jet and has the ability Propeller Tail, which ignores redirects. However, Barraskewda hits very hard with Aqua Jet, even with a 0 IV, so be careful hitting your Coalossal with it. For other Pokemon, the best way to get around it is to take out the redirector on the first turn and hope that your opponents other Pokemon doesn&#8217;t hit too hard.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Fast Pokemon &#8211; Surf Counter</h4>



<p>Surf is not a priority move. Your opponent can go before you and potentially OHKO your Water Enabler or Coalossal before you get a chance to activate Steam Engine. </p>



<p>A Focus Sash on your Water Enabler can keep them alive through at least one hit. Picking a high speed Surf Pokemon is important to not run into this counter too often.</p>

<p>The first expansion for Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield, the Isle of Armor, adds many conveniences. Most of these additions help in maxing out Pokemon and getting them ready for competition. However, Isle of Armor also adds a whole new way to farm Pokedollars that is more simple than any other farm. This guide will show you the easiest money farm in the game.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Unlocking the Cram-o-matic</h3>



<p>The Cram-o-Matic is a new vendor in the Isle of Armor. It is located inside the Master Dojo. You unlock it by giving 500 Watts to Hyde, who is usually <em>hiding</em> at his desk. This machine takes four of your items and gives you a new item in return. There are recipes that guarentee specific items or get you an item from a list of items. For instance, giving it four of the same Apricorn will give you back a Pokeball from the drop table of that color. If you want to learn the recipes yourself without looking them up, Hyde will teach you one for every 100 Watts you give him.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Farming Money Using the Cram-o-matic</h3>

<p>To farm money by doing nothing but spamming A, you&#8217;ll need to craft <strong>TR88 Heat Crash</strong>. The recipe is <strong>four Cheri Berries</strong>. Cheri Berries can be purchased for 80 Pokedollars each from the berry vendor just outside the Master Dojo. The TR sells for 3,000 Pokedollars, giving you a profit of 2,680 Pokedollars. After the initial craft, your cursor will remain on Cheri Berry. This allows you to just press A to repeat the process. </p>

<p>The Master Dojo has an <a href="/isle-of-armor-dojo-upgrades/">upgrade system</a> that will allow you purchase vitamins for half the price they used to be.

<p>Max Raid Battles are a staple of Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield. These battles pit you and three other Players/NPCs against a permanently Dynamaxed Pokemon. A quick and efficient Max Raid Battle farm strategy is a must for endgame Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Access Max Raid Battles</h2>



<p>The first way to access Max Raid Battles is to find the glowing dens around the Wild Area. These glowing dens spawn throughout the day, giving you a number of free fights. Every glowing den contains a Max Raid Battle that you can choose to invite others to or do offline with NPCs. </p>



<p>The second method to spawn a Max Raid battle is to use a Wishing Piece on a den that is NOT currently glowing. This will spawn a Max Raid Battle at that den, which can then be completed like a normal battle. Wishing pieces can be earned in a number of ways, but purchasing them with Watts is the most consistent.</p>



<p>The final method of accessing Max Raid Battles is to join someone else&#8217;s using the Y-Comm. This will allow you to search for other people who are looking for people to help them with their Max Raid Battles. With a Nintendo Switch Online membership, you can search for other players using the internet. Without this connection, you will have to be physically close to the Switch of the person you want to play with over Local Communications. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Farm Max Raid Battles</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Host Your Own</h3>



<p>The simplest way to complete as many Max Raid Battles as possible is to create them yourself. If you create them yourself, you won&#8217;t have to deal with the issues with Y-Comm even if you choose to have other join you using it. Every day you will get a few free battles. Once these are completed, you can continue spawning more using wishing pieces. To sustain this method, you will have to spend Watts. </p>



<p>To help with this, you can spend any Armorite you are getting from Isle of Armor battles at <a href="/farm-watts-in-isle-of-armor/">Digging Pa</a>. Assuming the worst case scenario of only getting 1 Armorite per raid battle, you will need to get at least 21,000 Watts on average from Digging Pa. Considering you will sometimes get 2 or 3 Armorite per wishing piece, this is a sustainable way to farm Armorite Ore, Watts, and all of the other rewards from Max Raid Battles.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Join Others</h3>



<p><em>Your Switch needs to be connected to the internet using Nintendo Switch Online to use this method.</em></p>



<p>The most efficient way to farm Max Raid battles is to join other players, saving your Watts for your <a href="/isle-of-armor-dojo-upgrades/">3 Million Watt Dojo Upgrades</a>. You can do this from anywhere using the Y-Comm to search for &#8220;Seeking&#8221; cards. If you ever tried to just join a card that comes up, you&#8217;ve likely been met with a message saying that it is full or no longer available. The reason for this is that the Y-Comm does not update regularly, so by the time you apply, other players have already filled it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/max-raid-battle-farm-number-reached.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="936" height="438" src="/wp-content/uploads/max-raid-battle-farm-number-reached.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9241" style="width:936px" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/max-raid-battle-farm-number-reached.jpg 936w, /wp-content/uploads/max-raid-battle-farm-number-reached-300x140.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/max-raid-battle-farm-number-reached-768x359.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></a></figure>



<p>To get around this issue, you will have to convince Y-Comm to send you updates more often. To do this, start a &#8220;Surprise Trade.&#8221; You won&#8217;t actually be trading this Pokemon, but pick one you wouldn&#8217;t mind trading, just in case. Once you have started searching for a Surprise Trade partner, open the Y-Comm again and you will see that the cards are refreshing at a much faster pace. When you see a raid battle you want, spam A on it. This will cancel your current Surprise Trade and join the Max Raid battle. You will normally join around the 2:47 mark if you get in quick. </p>



<p>Despite joining so quickly, many other people know this strategy, so you are still likely to run into full battles, especially for the rare fights. If you run into a full room or an error, queue up another Surprise Trade and try again. Also, be sure to check the icons shown on the cards. A lock indicates that a password is required (likely someone hosting for a friend) and the Isle of Armor symbol indicates an Isle of Armor battle. Only Isle of Armor battles will reward Armorite Ore.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Digging Ma &#8211; The Fastest Armorite Ore Farm</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/armorite-ore-farm-digging-ma.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="860" height="530" src="/wp-content/uploads/armorite-ore-farm-digging-ma.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8224" style="width:297px" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/armorite-ore-farm-digging-ma.jpg 860w, /wp-content/uploads/armorite-ore-farm-digging-ma-300x185.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/armorite-ore-farm-digging-ma-768x473.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Don&#8217;t make Digging Ma&#8217;s lovely shovel sad!</figcaption></figure>



<p>This farm is for those who are looking to maximize their Armorite per minute. Armorite Ore is a new currency in the Isle of Armor that is spent to teach your Pokemon new moves, reset their EVs to 0, or exchange for Watts. Remember that you&#8217;ll need <strong>3,280,000 Watts</strong> to buy all of the <a href="/isle-of-armor-dojo-upgrades/">Master Dojo upgrades</a>, and Armorite Ore is the fastest way to farm Watts.</p>



<p>The fastest and most reliable way to farm Armorite is through Digging Ma. Digging Ma will give you at least 1 Armorite every time you find her, with an option to gamble for more. Digging Ma has 15 different locations that she can spawn. She will move to one of the other 14 locations each time you find her. This can be repeated an infinite number of times a day, with no diminishing returns. She will not change positions on day change or any other event; you have to find her to get her to move.</p>



<p>An optimal route can check each location in just over 4 minutes and 30 seconds. This means that, worst case scenario, you will be finding Digging Ma 13 times an hour. With an average return of just over one Armorite per find (see below for gambling strategy), this comes out to 13 Armorite per hour <strong>minimum</strong>. </p>



<p>The <em>normal </em>outcome is much higher, since it checks the fastest ones first. With an average time of 17 seconds per spot, and finding her after 7.5 checks on average, you should be expecting to get just over <strong>28 Armorite per hour</strong>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Gambling Your Armorite Ore</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/armorite-ore-farm-gamble.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="862" height="514" src="/wp-content/uploads/armorite-ore-farm-gamble.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8225" style="width:246px" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/armorite-ore-farm-gamble.jpg 862w, /wp-content/uploads/armorite-ore-farm-gamble-300x179.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/armorite-ore-farm-gamble-768x458.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px" /></a></figure>



<p>Every time you find Digging Ma, she will offer you one Armorite Ore, with the option to gamble this ore for two. If you are successful on a gamble, she will ask if you want to keep going. You can continue until her shovel breaks, at which time you lose all of the ore you would have gotten. However, there is a rare chance that when her shovel breaks, it will instead get you more ore. </p>



<p>The probability is still being tested and discussed, but the general consensus, including my own testing, is that a <strong>single gamble will produce the most Armorite Ore</strong> over time. It looks to be close to a 50/50 percent chance of success, which would normally break even. However, with the chance of getting the lucky extra dig on a break, it ends up giving a slightly higher return by gambling once.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc">Armorite Farm Route</h3>



<p>This route checks all 15 location as quickly as possible, prioritizing the quickest ones first. Digging Ma will not render until you are relatively close, but her shovel can be seen from much further away. Once you have a general idea of the run, try to look for the shovel, circled in red, instead of getting closer. Once you find her, start from the beginning again, keeping in mind that she cannot be in the same place twice in a row.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Slower Armorite Farm, But Perhaps the Better</h2>



<p>Digging Ma is the most reliable and quick way to farm Armorite Ore, but it will get boring fast. It will only give you Armorite Ore (unless you stop to fight along the way). If you are looking for a break from the grind, while still making progress, or are interested in TRs and EXP Candies, you might want to try farming Isle of Armor Max Raid Battles.</p>



<p>Max Raid Battles on the Isle of Armor give Armorite as well, but at a much less consistent, and generally slower, pace. However, there are additional benefits to Max Raid Battles. You will have to deal with the frustrating Y-COMM system to farm efficiently though, so check out <a href="/max-raid-battle-farm/">our guide</a> to find the most best method to farm Max Raid Battles.</p>

<p>Watts have been an important currency in Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield since its launch. But now, with the new Isle of Armor Expansion, they are more important than ever. The old Watt farm, prior to Isle of Armor, was to go around to each den and collect the Watts trickling out. This worked in the base game because the Watt requirements were generally low. However, in Isle of Armor, there is a better Watt farm to offset the amount of Watts the expansion encourages you to get.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What Are Watts Used For?</h3>



<ul>
<li>Wishing Pieces (used to create Max Raid Battles at empty dens)</li>



<li>Watt Traders (selling many different Technical Records (TRs) and uncommon Pokeball types)</li>



<li>Fossils, evolution stones, vendor trash, held items, and even Bottle Caps from the Digging Duo</li>



<li>Various vendor trash items from NPCs</li>



<li>Pokedex entries for species you haven&#8217;t seen yet (Isle of Armor only)</li>



<li>Apricorns (Isle of Armor only)</li>



<li>Dojo upgrades (Isle of Armor only)</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How Many Watts Do You Need?</h3>



<p>The number of Watts required in the base game was generally quite low, and old methods of just riding around and collecting your daily Watts were sufficient. However, with the Isle of Armor expansion, there is a new reason to spend Watts that will take a while to complete. Your dojo is an up-gradable home base on the Isle of Armor. To see what you can unlock at your new home base, check out our guide on <a href="/isle-of-armor-dojo-upgrades/">upgrading your dojo</a>.</p>



<p>To get all of the rewards from upgrading your dojo, you will need to donate a total of <strong>3,280,000 Watts!</strong> At 200 Watts for each den, that would take up to 16,400 dens. Luckily though, Isle of Armor also gave us a better Watt Farm.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fastest Watt Farm In Isle of Armor</h3>



<p>Digging Pa, father to the Digging Duo, will let you exchange seven Armorite Ore at a time for Watts. The exact number you get is up to chance, but it is certainly the best way to earn Watts quickly and efficiently. Digging Pa usually only gives you about 20,000 &#8211; 30,000 Watts per 7 Armorite Ore, but can go up into the hundreds of thousands!</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">Digging Pa can be found at the Training Lowlands fast travel point, just outside the cave. Your first encounter with him will be free, to teach you how the system works. </p>
</div></div>



<p>Every roll he will ask you if he should stop there. There is no reason to ever tell him to stop digging; keep spamming &#8216;A&#8217; to maximize your run. There is a chance that when he would otherwise be done, he will instead go on a spree of large Watt digs and then continue with a whole new set of normal digs. These random chances are where you can quickly pass 100,000 Watts.</p>



<p>This method does require you to have an abundant amount of Armorite Ore however. The faster you get Armorite Ore you can earn, the faster you can earn Watts. Check out our guide on farming Armorite Ore to maximize your Armorite output, and in turn, your Watts.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are the Dojo Upgrades Worth It?</h3>



<p>While most of the upgrades add things that can be found elsewhere, there are a few things that can only be obtained through this process. </p>



<p>If you are into competitive Pokemon, the most important upgrade to get are the vitamins. These items are used to upgrade your Pokemon&#8217;s Effort Values (EVs). While they could already be purchased in the base game, they can be bought in bulk at half the normal price through the dojo. This means that filling out a blank competitive Pokemon&#8217;s EVs will only cost just over 250,000 Pokédollars instead of the normal 500,000.</p>



<p>If you are into cosmetics, namely League Cards, there is one background for your League Card and two collectible NPC League Cards that can only be obtained through these upgrades</p>
