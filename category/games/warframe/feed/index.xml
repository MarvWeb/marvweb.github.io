<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Prime Resurgence</h2>



<p>Prime Resurgence is an event in Warframe that will temporarily replace the existing Vaulted Relic system for Prime parts. Instead of earning the current &#8220;unvaulted&#8221; relics from missions in the void, Tenno will instead earn a new currency, Aya, that can be spent on vaulted relics. The relics available to be purchased will change each week of the event.</p>



<p>You will also be able to purchase a premium version of Aya, Regal Aya, for real money. This premium currency can be spent to purchase the Prime weapons and warframes outright instead of going through the normal relic process. It can also be used to purchase items given out as part of the Amazon Prime &#8220;Prime Gaming&#8221; program. Regal Aya will not be earnable in game, cannot be purchased with Platinum, and cannot be traded; the only way to get Regal Aya is to buy it. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When is  Prime Resurgence </h2>



<p>Prime Resurgence will be available from <strong>November 16th, 2021</strong> until <strong>January 25th, 2022</strong>. Each week will feature a different pair of Prime Warframes and their associated Prime weapons. The schedule is as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Nov. 16 &#8211; Nov. 22: Mag &amp; Nova  </li>



<li>Nov. 23 &#8211; Nov. 29: Limbo &amp; Trinity</li>



<li>Nov. 30 &#8211; Dec. 06: Mesa &amp; Hydroid</li>



<li>Dec. 07 &#8211; Dec. 13: Volt &amp; Loki</li>



<li>Dec. 14 &#8211; Dec. 20: Vauban &amp; Ash</li>



<li>Dec. 21 &#8211; Dec. 27: Oberon &amp; Nekros</li>



<li>Dec. 28 &#8211; Jan. 03: Valkyr &amp; Saryn</li>



<li>Jan. 04 &#8211; Jan. 10: Ember &amp; Frost</li>



<li>Jan 11. &#8211; Jan. 18: Mag, Nova, Limbo, Trinity, Hydroid, Mesa, Volt, &amp; Loki</li>



<li>Jan. 18 &#8211; Jan. 25: Ash, Vauban, Nekros, Oberon, Saryn, Valkyr, Ember, &amp; Frost</li>
</ul>



<p>The final two weeks of the event will be a last chance to participate in the event, likely offering multiple Primes that were offered in previous weeks.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Farm Aya</h2>



<p>Aya will replace &#8220;unvaulted&#8221; relics during the event, meaning that doing missions in the Void and Bounties on Cetus/Fortuna/Necralisk has a chance to earn you the new currency. The amount of Aya you earn is not dependent upon the era of the relic; you earn one Aya for every vaulted Axi, Neo, Meso, and Lith relic you would have otherwise gotten. Since you can buy the Axi relics for one Aya, this essentially means you can trade a vaulted Lith for a vaulted Axi &#8211; a good trade! </p>



<p>Spamming short Void missions like Hepit, Ukko, or Marduk is the most effective way of farming Aya, but there is some luck involved since you will only earn Aya if you would have normally gotten a vaulted relic. Since relic rarity doesn&#8217;t seem to matter, The Capture missions are the better choice. <strong>Hepit will be the fastest way to farm</strong>, with Ukko being only slightly behind it because of the increased enemy level. As with most Capture mission farms, if you mission changes to an Exterminate, it is often faster to leave and restart the mission.</p>



<p>Bounties are also a good way to earn Aya, but these missions will take much longer to complete. Choose to do bounties if you need reputation with the associated faction or other items that come from bounties. If you are just looking to maximize Aya, Void missions are better.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Spend Aya</h2>



<p>Aya can be spent at Varzia who is located in Maroo&#8217;s Bazaar on Mars during the event. In addition to the current offering of vaulted relics, you can also purchase Syandanas, Orbiter skins, Sigils, Glyphs, and Ducats.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Lore of Aya</h2>



<p>Varzia describes Aya as an &#8220;Orokin sequencing medium.&#8221; This means that Aya is a type of storage material used by the Orokin. The Orokin used Aya in Ayatan Statues to record many of their violent acts. Varzia is happy that Maroo is melting down these statues and erasing the terrible history of the Orokin. She believes that the Prime Warframe data held within should be retained though.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but think of a particular Twitch emote when seeing the name though&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If Lavos's new cooldown-based system is going to continue for future Warframes, some changes need to be made.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The newest Warframe added in Operation: Orphix Venom, Lavos, is a truly unique Warframe. Lavos&#8217;s abilities use a traditional cooldown (CD) system rather the energy system every other Warframe uses (even Hildryn, to an extent). This is a new path for Warframe, and definitely one that I&#8217;m interested in future Warframes exploring more. However, if this cooldown system is going to continue some changes to the system need to be made.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>



<ul><li>Lavos&#8217;s ability&#8217;s CDs are too short, potentially leading to 100% of playtime</li><li>Short CDs discourage the use of weapons, an integral part of Warframe</li><li>CD based rotations don&#8217;t fit well into Warframe&#8217;s current playstyle as they encourage rotations rather pooling energy for the right situation</li></ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-role-of-warframe-abilities">The Role of Warframe Abilities</h2>



<p>This CD system has made me reevaluate what exactly I want from Warframe abilities. When I think of my personal favorite Warframes like Saryn and Nekros their abilities generally augment the core system of blade and gun. Even when their abilities don&#8217;t really interact with the core weapon based experience of Warframe, you&#8217;ll often quickly find yourself going right back into shooting and swinging.</p>



<p>The exception to this would be builds like Khora&#8217;s Whipclaw Crit build, where almost all of your damage ends up coming from the ability rather than weapons. Same with Volt Discharge in Sanctuary Onslaught; you end up just spamming the one ability rather than ever pulling out your weapon. The difference here though is that these Warframes still work as intended without these builds. Khora and Volt are perfectly effective with non ability-spam builds. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-much-time-is-left-in-between-lavos-s-abilities">How Much Time is Left In-Between Lavos&#8217;s Abilities</h2>



<p>Where I think the biggest issue lies with Lavos is that his cooldowns are so short that they encourage constant use. His abilities can be cast every <em>8/5/10/30 </em>seconds respectively. Disregarding the CD reduction from Transmutation Probe, in any 30 second window Lavos can spend up to 22.29 seconds casting abilities. That&#8217;s just under 75% of his time casting abilities. To further add to this time, each ability can also be augmented with a single (ex. Toxin) or dual (ex. Viral) element. Augmenting a single element takes about one second, so a dual Augment (arguably what you &#8220;should&#8221; be doing) would add two seconds to every cast. As you can see from the table below, <strong>you can choose to focus 100% of your time on casting Lavos&#8217;s abilities.</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-big-issue-mixing-weapons-into-lavos-s-playstyle">The Big Issue &#8211; Mixing Weapons Into Lavos&#8217;s Playstyle</h2>



<p>The above information shows that it is possible to ONLY cast abilities with Lavos, leaving zero time for weapon usage. The obvious argument is to just leave some of these abilities off CD for a while and do some damage with weapons. While I agree that you can always choose to do so, we here at MarvWeb aim for efficient and optimal gameplay.</p>



<p>The truth is that one of these two styles will be more effective at any time. If your weapons are better at killing enemies than your abilities, you should never cast those abilities. Conversely, if you abilities are better at killing enemies, you should use them as much as possible. The latter is often true with most Warframes: it is often true that abilities surpass weapons in effectiveness, meaning they take higher priority for efficient gameplay. Again, think of Khora&#8217;s Whipclaw: because Whipclaw is stronger than weapons and you can constantly use Whipclaw, from a min/max perspective, weapons should never be used.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have a potato&#8217;d, max forma&#8217;d Lavos, so I can&#8217;t say for sure which abilities of his end up surpassing weapons. However, since I view Lavos as an experiment for future Warframes, there is a chance that all of a CD-based Warframe&#8217;s abilities &#8220;should&#8221; be cast as often as possible to maximize DPS. <strong>If Lavos&#8217;s abilities are good, they &#8220;should&#8221; be all you do; if they are not good, then you &#8220;should&#8221; never cast them.</strong></p>



<p>This binary relationship is something that needs to be addressed with Lavos and any future CD-based Warframe. <strong>Weapons are an integral part of Warframe and a Warframe&#8217;s intended playstyle should not discourage their use. </strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-smaller-issue-energy-pooling-vs-casting-on-cooldown">A Smaller Issue &#8211; Energy Pooling vs. Casting on Cooldown</h2>



<p>The idea of Cooldowns also poses another issue. Often time in Warframe you will save your abilities for the perfect moment where they will be most effective. The reason we have this flexibility is the ability to pool energy without a lose of theoretical DPS. The mod Flow that increases your energy pool is so widely used because often time the best way to use energy is to wait for a good time, rather than use your energy the second you get it. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cd-warframe-abilities.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1624"/></figure></div>



<p>CD-based abilities however cannot be pooled; you are losing potential DPS every moment they are off CD. This leads to a use-or-lose mentality that is not fun to play, and feels antithetical to what I&#8217;ve loved about Warframe over the past almost eight years. If you try to save for the perfect scenario, it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll have been able to cast the ability multiple times in-between, effectively losing that DPS. If you use the ability whenever it comes off CD, it might be on CD when the perfect situation arises. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-change-in-playstyle-putting-all-your-eggs-into-one-ability">A Change in Playstyle &#8211; Putting All Your Eggs Into One Ability</h2>



<p>Similar to the pooling issue, most Warframe&#8217;s can choose to cast their &#8220;best&#8221; ability over and over. You can choose to dump all of your energy into a single ability, essentially offsetting the relative ineffectiveness of your other abilities. You can cast Volt&#8217;s Discharge way more often if you choose to not cast his other abilities. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/volt-discharge-featured-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1354"/></figure>



<p>Lavos, and potentially any other CD-based Warframe, cannot choose to ignore their less effective abilities to increase the usage of their more effective abilities. For instance, you cannot cast Catalyze more often by choosing to never cast Vial Rush. Catalyze is on a 30 sec CD, and nothing can be done about that. </p>



<p>This leads to a <em>rotation</em>, a term often used in MMOs and RPGs. The most effective way to play a CD-based Warframe will often come down pressing abilities the moment they come off CD. The issue here is that it leads to players having to constantly look at the bottom right to monitor their CDs so that they can execute them at the optimal time. </p>



<p>Many RPGs offset this issue by presenting CDs visually in an easy to see manner, allowing you to focus on the gameplay and see that the CD is ready without moving you eyes away from the action. Warframe currently does not have a system like this. Playing Lavos I find myself constantly looking at the CDs to see what is ready.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-fix-these-issues">How to Fix These Issues</h2>



<p>The fix to the major issue of invalidating weapons is really quite simple. These abilities need to have longer CDs and shorter cast times. This nerf can be offset by buffing the ability&#8217;s effectiveness or duration. To address the constant casting on Lavos, Elemental Augments should not go away once selected. This alone will remove up to two seconds of casting from every ability. Just make a new chosen element overwrite the existing one, reset the elemental augment after a decent amount of time, or give us a new single button to clear the chosen element.</p>



<p>Another good change that can avoid this situation for future CD-based Warframe abilities is to make the ability augment weapon-play rather than be independent of it. Abilities should integrate into weapon gameplay, not replace it. Abilities could increase to weapon damage, add an elemental augment to weapons, add an AoE to weapons, etc. This would be great candidates for CD based abilities. Don&#8217;t give them constant uptime; let us activate them when we need the increased damage against groups or tough enemies. This temporary increase in power at the right moment is what is so rewarding about similar systems in MMOs and RPGs.</p>



<p>The issue with pooling vs. casting on CD can be offset with a simple charge system. Having multiple charges smooths CDs and allows you to essentially pool your CDs for the right moment. You don&#8217;t feel obligated to use an ability as soon as it&#8217;s ready because you are still actively gaining another charge, eliminating the potential lost DPS.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1236257-update-295-deimos-arcana/">Patch 29.5, Deimos Arcana</a>, adds new content to Warframe. This content patch comes with a new Necramech, changes to Steel Essence acquisition, new weapons including Infested Kitguns, and many other small changes. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="bonewidow-necramech">Bonewidow Necramech</h2>



<p>Unlike the Voidrig, the second Necramech to be added to the game is focused on <strong>melee</strong>. The <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Bonewidow">Bonewidow </a>has an exalted melee weapon as its fourth ability, and its other abilities are also focused on melee. </p>



<p>Its blueprints can be acquired from the <a href="/warframe/deimos/necraloid-syndicate/">Necraloid Syndicate</a>, with the main blueprint obtainable at max rank (Rank 3: Odima) for <strong>10,000 standing</strong> and the <strong>four </strong>component blueprints requiring <strong>3,500 standing each</strong>. The component blueprints will require damaged parts obtained from <a href="/warframe/deimos/isolation-vaults/">isolation vaults</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="infested-kitguns">Infested Kitguns</h2>



<p>Infested Kitguns are primary and secondary weapons that are built from components just like their Fortuna counterparts. There are new Infested style <strong>chambers, grips, and loaders</strong>. These parts can be purchased from <a href="/warframe/deimos/entrati-syndicate#father">Father</a> for Entrati Standing. Once purchased, talk with Rude Zudd in Fortuna to put the gun together. You can mix and match Kitgun components from Fortuna too. Check out the <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Kitgun#Primary">Kitgun page on the wiki</a> for more specifics on each part.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="steel-path-incursions">Steel Path Incursions</h2>



<p>Deimos Arcana adds a <strong>new way to acquire Steel Essence</strong>. Every day there will be five Steel Path incursions that will reward Steel Essence when completed. These missions will be available to everyone who has access to the Steel Path, even if the node has not been unlocked, helping with matchmaking. </p>



<p>In addition, any Steel Path mission can now spawn Acolytes. These Acolytes will drop two Steel Essences when defeated, but will run away if they down you. Teshin&#8217;s inventory has been updated with new wares to spend Steel Essence on, including rare items like <strong>Umbra Forma</strong> blueprints.</p>



<p>Check out our <a href="/warframe/steel-path/">Steel Path guide</a> for tips on this difficult game mode.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="isolation-vault-changes-in-deimos-arcana">Isolation Vault Changes in Deimos Arcana</h2>



<p>Deimos Arcana focuses a lot on changes to <a href="/warframe/deimos/isolation-vaults/">Isolation Vaults</a>, adding four new ruins. New items gave been added as rewards for isolation vaults. There are also some new encounters in isolation vaults, offering some variety for extended runs. The <strong>speed of Loid has been increased</strong>, while his health has been decreased. Scintillants inside the vaults now have a chance to respawn, so if you get the same vault on an extended run, you can still get more. </p>



<p>You now have a chance to fight the new Bonewidow Necramech instead of just the normal Voidrig. The difficulty of these enemy Necramechs has also been adjusted by giving them many of the <strong>characteristics of Kuva Liches</strong>, like diminishing returns on status effects instead of immunity. </p>

<p>In addition to the items that have been added as part of this patch, the <a href="/warframe/deimos/entrati-syndicate/">Entrati Syndicate</a> has had some other small changes. You can now obtain every family member&#8217;s tokens from Grandmother through her new &#8220;Mend the Family&#8221; option. This gives an alternate way to obtain tokens other than engaging with that specific family member&#8217;s content. </p>



<p>There is a new evergreen use for <a href="/warframe/deimos/necraloid-syndicate/">Necraloid Syndicate</a> standing. You can now exchange <strong>50,000 Necraloid Standing</strong> for a Ayatan Sculpture with a base value of 450 Endo. With four Cyan and one Amber Ayatan installed, it has a value of <strong>3000 Endo</strong>. </p>



<p>Two new mods have been added to Sons inventory. Martyr Symbiosis gives Vulpaphyla the ability to store health from enemy deaths and heal their master. Volatile Parasite spawns a parasite that attaches to enemies, forcing other enemies to attack it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hildryn can regain the shield spent on Defy during its invulnerability, allowing her to spam Defy forever and making her nearly invincible.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There is a reason I ranked <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Defy">Defy </a>so high in my <a href="/helminth-abilities-which-are-best/">subsume ability tier list</a>. This Hildryn build uses Wukong&#8217;s Helminth ability, Defy, to become immune to damage and reflect damage back to enemies. Because Hildryn uses shields to cast Defy, and she regains those shields during the invulnerability duration, <strong>Hildryn can spam Defy forever.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>



<ul>
<li>Give Hildryn the ability Defy</li>



<li>Mod for high shield regen and ability strength/range/duration</li>



<li>Spam Defy to be invulnerable and reflect damage </li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="unlocking-defy-on-hildryn">Unlocking Defy on Hildryn</h2>



<p>To be able to use Defy on Hildryn, you will need to <a href="/how-to-unlock-the-helminth-heart-of-deimos/">unlock your Helminth</a>. Once you have it unlocked, you&#8217;ll need to subsume a non-prime Wukong to unlock its ability. Once this is done, you can replace one of Hildryn&#8217;s abilities with Defy using the Helminth. </p>



<p>I replaced <strong>Aegis Storm</strong> because I never saw myself floating around CCing when I could be spamming Defy. <strong>Haven </strong>would have been my other choice as I don&#8217;t use it often either, but it can be decent in a group setting for supporting your allies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/hildryn-defy-subsume.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/hildryn-defy-subsume-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9127" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/hildryn-defy-subsume-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/hildryn-defy-subsume-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/hildryn-defy-subsume-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/hildryn-defy-subsume-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/hildryn-defy-subsume.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Use the Helminth to replace Aegis Storm or Haven with Defy</em></figcaption></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-build">The build</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="warframe">Warframe</h3>



<p>Hildryn uses shields to cast abilities. This includes abilities added by the Helminth. Defy costs Hildryn 500 shields unmodded to cast. However, because it makes her invulnerable and take no damage from attacks, <strong>shield recharge</strong> starts during the invulnerability of Defy.</p>



<p>All four ability enhancements are useful, so this build doesn&#8217;t use too many corrupted mods. That said, ability efficiency is the least helpful. With a good amount of shields and shield recharge, you will regain the shields spent on Defy during the invulnerability duration. </p>



<p>Since there is a very small window in between Defys that you are vulnerable, <strong>Arcane Barrier</strong> can help you get back your shields and be able to cast Defy again. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/hildryn-defy-warframe.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="352" src="/wp-content/uploads/hildryn-defy-warframe-1024x352.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9128" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/hildryn-defy-warframe-1024x352.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/hildryn-defy-warframe-300x103.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/hildryn-defy-warframe-768x264.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/hildryn-defy-warframe-1536x528.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/hildryn-defy-warframe.jpg 1581w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Shield maximum, shield regen, and everything but ability efficiency</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For the last mod slot, if you are doing very high level content, you can bring<strong> <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Adaptation">Adaptation</a></strong><a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Adaptation"> </a>to cover the small amount of time you are vulnerable. Remember though you wont gain Adaptation stacks while invulnerable from Defy.</p>



<p>If you are running lower level content or there are large gaps between enemies, <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Rush"><strong>Rush</strong> </a>is a good option to make you a bit faster.</p>



<p><strong>Arcane Aegis</strong> is a decent choice for the second Arcane since it helps get your shields back. You can bring weapon damage boost Arcanes if you are planning to use you weapons a bit and not just spam Defy the whole mission. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="companion">Companion</h3>



<p>In high level content, you companion will very likely die. However, there are some very helpful things that come from companions like item vacuum, loot and enemy radar, and most importantly for this build, <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian">Guardian</a>. This make the <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Djinn"><strong>Djinn </strong></a>a great option as it can recover from death forever and continue giving you all these benefits. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="weapons">Weapons</h3>



<p>Weapons are up to you. This build is targeted at high level content where almost all of your damage will be from reflected Defy damage. For long endless missions, you can bring an AoE Radiation proc weapon like Ignis Wraith to clear Eximus buffs from groups. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-vivid-purple-color has-css-opacity has-vivid-purple-background-color has-background"/>



<script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4537180102637521" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4537180102637521" data-ad-slot="5280630734"></ins>

</script>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="usage">Usage</h2>



<p>The execution of this build really is as easy as <strong>spamming Defy</strong>. During the invulnerability, you will regenerate the amount of shield you spent. Once it runs out, cast it again. Try to group enemies up and move near them to maximize the reflected damage. </p>



<p>Even spamming though, there is a brief window where you will be vulnerable. If the enemies are able to reduce your shield to the point where you cannot cast Defy during that very short window, run away and recharge shields. Hopefully though your companion and Arcane Barrier cover these rare instances.</p>



<p>This build excels at <strong>large groups or hard hitting enemies</strong>. The more damage you take during your Defy, the more damage you reflect back. This build also works better solo, as enemies will be more likely to shoot you instead of your allies.</p>



<p>This is not a speed running build. When channeling Defy, you will not be able to jump or move quickly. This build is better in situations where you are staying in one general area like Survival.</p>

<p>With this specialized Octavia build, you can stay in a Survival mission for as long as you want.

This build even works with <a href="/the-steel-path/">Steel Path</a>, making it a great Steel Essence farm in addition to the other resources you&#8217;ll be getting.</p>



<p>Steel Essence has a low chance to drop from Eximus enemies in Steel Path missions. Eximus enemies have an increased chance to spawn as the survival mission progresses, capping at one hour.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Build: Octavia Mallet &amp; Stealth</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Warframe</h3>



<p>This build uses Octavia&#8217;s Mallet (#1) for damage and Metronome (#3) for stealth. Ability duration makes the strategy less energy reliant and reduces the amount of times you will need to recast abilities. Ability range is important for killing enemies as quickly as possible. Ability strength is helpful, but due to the nature of Mallet scaling off of damage taken, it is not too important.</p>



<p>Low defenses will not be a problem as Octavia can remain in stealth for the entire mission. The Arcane energize will help with energy management, but is not required. If you don&#8217;t have it, bring some Energy Restores just in case you get unlucky with energy drops.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/steel-essence-farm-octavia.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="356" src="/wp-content/uploads/steel-essence-farm-octavia-1024x356.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9349" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/steel-essence-farm-octavia-1024x356.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/steel-essence-farm-octavia-300x104.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/steel-essence-farm-octavia-768x267.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/steel-essence-farm-octavia-1536x534.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/steel-essence-farm-octavia.jpg 1578w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Duration &gt; Range &gt; Strength &gt; Efficiency</figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Weapon</h3>



<p>Weapon damage will quickly become irrelevant as the enemies scale higher. Therefore, the weapon for this strategy focuses on supporting the Mallet damage. Radiation status procs make the affected enemies part of their own team. This is very helpful in removing proximity based buffs, like Eximus or Ancients, from groups of enemies.</p>



<p>The most important aspect of the weapon is to spread radiation procs quickly. Ignis Wraith&#8217;s inherent punch through, wide AoE, fast attack rate, and high status chance make it perfect for this task. You can add damage if you want, but almost all of your damage will come from Mallet.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Steel Essence Farm: Which Survival Mission?</h2>



<p>I&#8217;ve tried a few different survival missions with this strategy. Personally, I found <strong>Mot in the Void</strong> to be the best. Corrupted enemies have high damage, deal that damage from medium range, and Heavy Gunners survive long enough to really boost up the Mallet damage. The Void tileset also has multiple rooms that are open and great for Mallet.</p>



<p>Dark Sector Infested missions like <strong>Gabii on Cerus</strong> can be good too, especially with the increase resource drop rate. However, Infested don&#8217;t work as well against Mallet. Most of them are melee enemies and won&#8217;t contribute to the scaling damage. Also, they will clog up in the tight corridors on the tileset, reducing the number of kills per second you will get.</p>



<p>Corpus don&#8217;t deal enough damage to quickly scale Mallet to counteract their shields, especially with Steel Path buffs. Also, most Corpus tilesets are not great for Mallet.</p>



<p>Grineer have a similar issue to Corpus. The amount of health and armor they have on Steel Path is just too much compared to their damage output.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Strategy: Watch the Mallet &#8211; Collect the Loot</h2>



<p>Start the mission by casting Metronome (#3) and crouching until you stealth. Maintain this stealth for the entire mission.</p>



<p>Find an open tile to maximize the effectiveness of Mallet (#1). Cast Mallet in a central location that can be seen throughout the room. Buff Mallet with Amp (#4) to increase its range. </p>



<p>With you in stealth, the Mallet will be the only viable target, making all enemies on the map run to attack it. The best rooms will force the enemies to come into the room a bit before attacking. This will stop them from crowding and blocking the doors. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Loot Carefully</h3>



<p>With Mallet, Amp, and stealth up, you&#8217;re free to collect loot. Be careful of Nullifier Crewman and other proximity effects while looting. Also, do not get too close to the Mallet to avoid splash damage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/steel-essence-farm-drops.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/steel-essence-farm-drops-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9345" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/steel-essence-farm-drops-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/steel-essence-farm-drops-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/steel-essence-farm-drops-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/steel-essence-farm-drops-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/steel-essence-farm-drops.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">With everything up, it&#8217;s time to loot</figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Enemy Immunity: Radiation Procs</h3>



<p>Enemy groups will include more Eximus as time progresses, up to a maximum chance at one hour. Sometimes these groups will have a composition of Eximus and Ancients that makes them immune to damage. If you see a bunch of zeroes popping up, it&#8217;s time to break up their friendship. </p>



<p>Radiation procs from Ignis will isolate enemies, meaning they will no longer receive buffs from others. Once on their own, they will die to Mallet like normal.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Steel Essence Farm Team</h2>



<p>If you are bringing friends, this farm can be even better. The team can use Octavia&#8217;s Metronome for stealth too, but you&#8217;ll have to be relatively coordinated on when to loot to keep everyone stealthed. </p>



<p>A <strong>Speedva</strong> (negative power strength Nova) can greatly increase the rate at which enemies die. <strong>Nekros</strong> can reroll bodies for even more loot. <strong>Khora&#8217;s</strong> Pilfering Strangledome and <strong>Hydroid&#8217;s</strong> Pilfering Swarm can also increase the amount of loot dropped, but might limit the effectiveness of Mallet.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Unlocking the Mission</h2>



<p>The Archaeo-Freighter on Europa is one of the 3 Grendel missions and awards you the Grendel Neuroptics blueprint. To unlock the Archaeo-Freighter mission, you will need to purchase a <em>Grendel Neuroptics Locator </em>from the Arbitration Honor vendor in the Arbiters of Hexis room on any relay. This item will cost 25 Vitus Essence (obtainable through Arbitrations), but is not consumed until you complete the mission; you will be able to attempt the mission as many times as you would like until you get the reward for winning.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Build</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Warframe &#8211; Hildryn</h3>



<p>Most Warframes will run out of energy very quickly on these no-mod missions, and even if they do get abilities off, those abilities will not do anything close to what their modded versions do. This build bypasses the energy issue by using Hildryn, who uses her shields as energy. The shield you gain from casting Pillage (#2) will be greater than the cost, allowing you to spam the ability. </p>



<p>While most mods do not effect you during these missions, augment mods still augment abilities. This build uses the augmented version of Hildryn&#8217;s Pillage, <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Blazing_Pillage">Blazing Pillage</a>, to deal damage and restore shields. To benefit from Blazing Pillage, you will need to have Haven (#3) up and be close enough for it to be effecting the enemy you want to burn. This augment will be the main source of damage. Without it, you won&#8217;t kill enemies fast enough to sustain life support.</p>



<p>The build also uses the augmented version of Balefire (#1), <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Balefire_Surge">Balefire Surge</a>, specifically to deal with nullifiers. Nullifiers would normally be immune to the damage from Blazing Pillage, but this augment removes their bubble forever. This augment is not needed, but makes the occasional nullifier much less threatening.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="540" src="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build-1024x540.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9097" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build-1024x540.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build-300x158.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build-768x405.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build.jpg 1059w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Only augment mods work</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Melee Weapon &#8211; Fragor Prime</h3>



<p>Most weapons will feel very underwhelming with no mods. You won&#8217;t be able to equip Blood Rush, so combo counter stacking won&#8217;t do much. The most effective weapons are those with innate elements (especially toxin for bypassing shields), a helpful moveset, or strong base damage. </p>



<p>The weapon I used to deal with Bursas and other tanky enemies was Fragor Prime. Even unmodded, this weapon has a great slam attack that does decent damage and knocks down in a wide area.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Strategy &#8211; Spam Pillage</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Kill Them Quick While Healing Yourself</h3>



<p>Your main source of damage is augmented Pillage (#2). For this augment to deal damage, the enemy will need to be in range of Haven (#3). Pillage should give you more than enough shields back to spam it indefinitely, but you will need to be relatively close to the enemy to actually deal damage. Try to stack enemies up, jump into the middle of them, and spam Pillage.</p>



<p>Like most survival missions, try to kill enemies as fast as possible to generate life support. Unlike normal survival missions, you will likely need to use many of the supplied canisters, so don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re behind for using them.</p>

<p>You will fight Bursas near the end. They can mostly be avoided, but they can be a nuisance. Use you Fragor to take the Bursas down, using Pillage to refill your shields as needed.</p>

<p>Nullifier Crewman will stop your Pillage from dealing damage or giving you shields. Use a full charge shot from Balefire (#1) augmented with Balefire Surge. This will permanently break their nullify bubble, making the just normal crewmen. </p>

<p>The Mine of Karishh on Europa is one of the 3 Grendel missions and awards you the Grendel Systems blueprint.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Build</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Warframe &#8211; Limbo</h3>



<p>This solo strategy relies on avoiding all combat and waiting for the excavators. With Limbo&#8217;s free access to the Rift Plane using dodge, the restrictions on mods and energy do not matter. You also will not need any augments for this strategy to work. Therefore, a no-mod Limbo is all you need.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-build.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="406" src="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-build-1024x406.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9109" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-build-1024x406.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-build-300x119.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-build-768x304.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-build.jpg 1371w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Just Limbo</em></figcaption></figure>

</script>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Strategy &#8211; Wait in the Rift</h2>



<p>As soon as you zone into the mission, dodge with Limbo to enter the rift. This will make you immune to all damage from enemies. Despite this immunity, enemies will still try to attack you, allowing you to distract them.</p>



<p>When an excavator comes up, run to the waypoint to spawn it while still in the rift. Let 20 seconds pass until the excavator runs out of power, distracting enemies as necessary to ensure it lives.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-rift.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="853" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-rift-853x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9114" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-rift-853x1024.jpg 853w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-rift-250x300.jpg 250w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-rift-768x922.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-rift.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Wait in the Rift</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Let the Excavators Die</h3>



<p>Once the excavator has run out of power, let it die. It will need to be gone for another excavator to spawn in that location. There is no limit on the number of excavators that will spawn, so don&#8217;t worry about running out. If no new excavators are spawning, encourage the enemies to destroy the existing ones.</p>



<p>Each excavator will give you 20 Cryotic with this strategy. This means that you will need 40 excavators to reach the 800 Cryotic you need. This will take a while, but is very safe and mostly AFK.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-excavator.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1018" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-excavator-1018x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9110" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-excavator-1018x1024.jpg 1018w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-excavator-298x300.jpg 298w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-excavator-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-excavator-768x772.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-excavator.jpg 1074w" sizes="(max-width: 1018px) 100vw, 1018px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>20 Cryotic per Excavator, 40 Excavators</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Notable Enemies</h3>



<p>Nullifier bubbles can pull you out of the rift. They can be mostly avoided, but sometimes they will be in tight corridors, making them unavoidable. If you have to pass through a nullifier bubble, bullet jump through, and dodge again as soon as you get past it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-nullifier.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="931" src="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-nullifier-1024x931.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9113" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-nullifier-1024x931.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-nullifier-300x273.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-nullifier-768x698.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-nullifier.jpg 1188w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Stay in the Rift Whenever Possible</em></figcaption></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Build</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Warframe &#8211; Hildryn</h3>



<p>Most Warframes will run out of energy very quickly on these no-mod missions, and even if they do get abilities off, those abilities will not do anything close to what their modded versions do. This build bypasses the energy issue by using Hildryn, who uses her shields as energy. The shield you gain from casting Pillage (#2) will be greater than the cost, allowing you to spam the ability. </p>



<p>While most mods do not effect you during these missions, augment mods still augment abilities. This build uses the augmented version of Hildryn&#8217;s Pillage, <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Blazing_Pillage">Blazing Pillage</a>, to deal damage and restore shields. To benefit from Blazing Pillage, you will need to have Haven (#3) up and be close enough for it to be effecting the enemy you want to burn. This augment will be the main source of damage. Without it, the enemies will destroy the defense target faster than you can kill them.</p>



<p>The build also uses the augmented version of Balefire (#1), <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Balefire_Surge">Balefire Surge</a>, specifically to deal with nullifiers. Nullifiers would normally be immune to the damage from Blazing Pillage, but this augment removes their bubble forever. This augment is not needed, but makes the occasional nullifier much less threatening.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="540" src="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build-1024x540.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9097" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build-1024x540.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build-300x158.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build-768x405.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build.jpg 1059w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Only augment mods work</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Melee Weapon &#8211; Fragor Prime</h3>



<p>Most weapons will feel very underwhelming with no mods. You won&#8217;t be able to equip Blood Rush, so combo counter stacking won&#8217;t do much. The most effective weapons are those with innate elements (especially toxin for bypassing shields), a helpful moveset, or strong base damage. </p>



<p>The weapon I used for the Bursas in wave #15 and other tanky enemies was Fragor Prime. Even unmodded, this weapon has a great slam attack that does decent damage and knocks down in a wide area.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Strategy &#8211; Spam Pillage</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Kill Them Before They Kill It</h3>



<p>Your main source of damage is augmented Pillage (#2). For this augment to deal damage, the enemy will need to be in range of Haven (#3). Pillage should give you more than enough shields back to spam it indefinitely, but you will need to be relatively close to the enemy to actually deal damage. </p>



<p>That being said, you will also want to remain close to the defense target. This will not only encourage enemies to attack into your limitless shields instead of the target, but also allow Haven to restore the shields of the target. Wait for your enemies to be about a bullet jump away. Get in, drop your burn from Pillage, and then get back to the defense target. The fire from Pillage will tick over time, killing most enemies with one or two casts.</p>



<p>Blazing Pillage will CC humanoid Corpus through heat procs, but if there are mechanical enemies that you need to CC, this is the time to use the Fragor. The slam attack will knock down targets and stop them from hitting the defense target.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Give the Defense Target a Break</h3>



<p>You won&#8217;t be able to stop all of the enemies from dealing damage to the defense target. Every wave, try to leave the last enemy alive and give the defense target a chance to regain its health and shields. Once you are down to one enemy, use the terrain to line of sight it so that it can&#8217;t hit you. If it can&#8217;t hit you for too long, it will go for the defense target instead, so every five seconds or so, jump or otherwise move into its line of sight to keep its attention.</p>



<p>Some waves you&#8217;ll accidentally kill every enemy and go right on to the next wave, but as long as you are healing the defense target back to full every few waves, you should never fail from it being destroyed. </p>

<p>15 waves will take a long time. Be ready for this mission to take a while and require your attention pretty much the entire fight. You only have to do this mission once (twice if you plan to give a Grendel to the <a href="https://marvweb.com/helminth-chrysalis-new-abilities-for-every-warframe/">Helminth Chrysalis</a>), so take it slow, especially once you get near the end. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Notable Enemies</h3>



<p>You will fight two Bursas in the last wave (#15). Generally the Bursas will focus on you, but try to go into the last wave with the defense target at full health to be safe. Take out the rest of the enemies first, then use you Fragor to take the Bursas down, using Pillage to refill your shields as needed.</p>

<p>Nullifier Crewman will stop your Pillage from dealing damage or giving you shields. Use a full charge shot from Balefire (#1) augmented with Balefire Surge. This will permanently break their nullify bubble, making the just normal crewmen. </p>
