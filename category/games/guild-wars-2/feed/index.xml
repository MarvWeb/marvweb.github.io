										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This Thief tagging build focuses on getting credit for as many enemies as possible in large group content like Meta Events and PvE Zergs. This build focuses on dishing out quick and consistent AoE damage that hits hard enough to get credit for the enemy&#8217;s death. This will maximize the amount of loot you get while running with large groups. </p>



<p>This is my personal favorite of all of my tagging builds. I feel that Thief outperforms every other class when it comes to maximizing kill credit. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Build</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thief-tagging-build.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thief-tagging-build.jpg" alt="The skills and traits for a thief tag build" class="wp-image-1042"/></a><figcaption><em>Thief Tagging Build</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Build Code: <em>[&amp;DQUsFTY9BxqUEgwBNAFbAVcBVgFYADMBnwEoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=]</em></strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Abilities</h3>



<p>This build relies on the spammable AoE of <strong>Trick Shot</strong>, the #1 ability on Shortbow. <strong>Infiltrator&#8217;s Arrow</strong> (Shortbow #5) can be used to catch up with groups or get out in front to secure tags. <strong>Cluster Bomb</strong> (Shortbow #2) for power builds or <strong>Choking Gas</strong> (Shortbow #4) for condition builds can be used to spread a bit of damage in a specific area, but often is not needed. Remember though that Cluster Bomb and Choking Gas will use up initiative that could otherwise be used on Infiltrator&#8217;s Arrows.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thief-tagging-abilities.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thief-tagging-abilities.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1043"/></a><figcaption><em>Weapons and Skills</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>For the heal skill, <strong>Channeled Vigor</strong> can be used as a utility skill to refill your endurance. Signet of Malice is a good choice for some mindless sustain if you don&#8217;t have Daredevil.</p>



<p>For Utility skills, I suggest <strong>Blinding Powder</strong> for those instances where you overextend or outrun the main group. <strong>Signet of Agility</strong> is great as another way to refill your endurance. However, if you are don&#8217;t have the permanent swiftness that Daredevil gives, consider bringing Signet of Shadows to increase your movement speed out of Swiftness. Finally, <strong>Shadowstep</strong> is a great gap closer, similar to Infiltrator&#8217;s Arrow with a longer reach. It will help keep you at the front of the group.</p>



<p>For the Elite Skill, <strong>Dagger Storm</strong> is a great skill to drop in the middle of a large group of enemies. Be sure to move around while channeling it to try to hit every enemy you can. </p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Traits</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thief-tagging-daredevil.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thief-tagging-daredevil.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1044"/></a><figcaption><em>Daredevil: 2 2 3</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Daredevil is a great addition to this build, as it supplies you with permanent Swiftness and augments your dodges to deal AoE damage. From the Daredevil tree, <strong>Escapist&#8217;s Fortitude</strong> allows you to clear troublesome conditions. <strong>Havoc Specialist</strong> will almost always be up with how often you will be dodge rolling. The last trait choice for Daredevil is up to you.<strong> Impaling Lotus</strong> will give you access to a lot of spammable point-blank AoE, but if you are having trouble keeping up with the group, Dash has a longer reach and increased Swiftness bonus.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-vivid-purple-background-color has-vivid-purple-color"/>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thief-tagging-trickery.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thief-tagging-trickery.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1045"/></a><figcaption><em>Trickery: 1 1 1</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Trickery further augments your dodge rolls to make them even more effective for tagging enemies while also supplying you with more initiative for Infiltrator&#8217;s Arrows. <strong>Uncatchable</strong> will leave caltrops, a 3 second duration AoE, at the location you dodge, even if you are using Dash. The tier 2 choice for Trickery is not all that impactful, but picking up <strong>Bountiful Theft</strong> will give boons to nearby allies, further increasing your chances getting loot from tagged enemies. Finally, <strong>Quick Pockets</strong> will help keep your initiative high for Infiltrator&#8217;s Arrows.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-vivid-purple-background-color has-vivid-purple-color"/>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thief-tagging-acrobatics.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thief-tagging-acrobatics.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1046"/></a><figcaption><em>Acrobatics: 1 3 3</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Acrobatics makes spamming dodge rolls easier with the minor trait Feline Grace. You also gain Swiftness every time you dodge and since this build can dodge so often, you can keep Swiftness up permanently. <strong>Instant Reflexes</strong> can save you from big hits since you will be quite squishy, giving you enough time to Blinding Powder or retreat. <strong>Hard to Catch</strong> is a great way to shrug off the occasional CC. Finally,<strong> Don&#8217;t Stop</strong> will keep you moving quick as long as you maintain Swiftness. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-vivid-purple-background-color has-vivid-purple-color"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stats</h3>



<p>You stat choice is not too important for this build, but I do suggest a full <strong>Berserker&#8217;s</strong> set if you can. This will nearly guarantee that a single hit from Trick Shot will give you kill credit on normal enemies. Survivability is not much of an issue with this build, as you will be at range with access to many dodge rolls.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-vivid-purple-background-color has-vivid-purple-color"/>



<script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4537180102637521" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4537180102637521" data-ad-slot="5280630734"></ins>

</script>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Playstyle</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Moving Group</h3>



<p>If the group is moving, <strong>stay near the front</strong> by maintaining Swiftness through dodge rolling and closing gaps with Infiltrator&#8217;s Arrow and Shadowstep. This will allow you to tag enemies early and move on to others. One Trick Shot hit will often be enough to get credit for the kill, especially with a Berserker&#8217;s set, allowing you to move to the next group. Try to target a different enemy with each shot, preferably one away from the last group of enemies you hit. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Camping Spawns</h3>



<p>When trying to tag enemies that your group is camping the spawn location of, drop a <strong>Choking Gas</strong> or dodge roll to <strong>drop caltrops</strong> on the spot enemies will spawn. Use Steal to buff nearby allies with Bountiful Theft, as often Choking Gas will not be enough damage to secure kill credit. Other than that, you can often get at least one Trick Shot off before groups die as long as you react quickly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Large Enemy Groups</h3>



<p>For large groups of many enemies, drop a few Chocking Gases or Cluster Bombs while you move into the enemy group. Once there, dodge roll to <strong>drop caltrops</strong> in the group and avoid damage. After you&#8217;ve spent your endurance, go into <strong>Dagger Storm</strong> to tag enemies near you. Use <strong>Shadowstep </strong>about halfway through the Dagger Storm channel to move to another concentrated group of enemies. Use your endurance refill abilities and keep using your dodge roll to tag nearby enemies. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">World vs. World</h3>



<p>This build does not perform as well in a PvP environment as it does in a PvE environment. This build is very squishy and can be quickly taken down by enemy players, even while sticking with a friendly team. It&#8217;s range is low, forcing you to move into dangerous ranges to even hit an enemy. However, if you are playing WvW more like a PvE game, moving uncontested between Forts and Keeps, this build works great at securing credit. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Learn the best places to quickly and efficiently farm Flax Seeds in Guild Wars 2. This guide includes the best spots from HoT and PoF.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pile_of_Flax_Seeds">Flax Seeds</a> continue to be in great demand due to them being an ingredient in <strong><a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vial_of_Linseed_Oil">Linseed Oil</a>,</strong> an item used in many recipes including Guild Hall upgrades. This guide will show you the best Flax Seed farm spots in Guild Wars 2 Heart of Thorns &amp; Path of Fire.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Flax Seed Farm Spots</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Flax with no fuss: <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jaka_Itzel">Jaka Itzel Waypoint</a> (Verdant Brink)</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/flax-farm-verdant-map.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/flax-farm-verdant-map-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-738"/></a><figcaption><em><a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jaka_Itzel">Jaka Itzel Waypoint</a> &#8211; Verdant Brink</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This is the best place to farm Flax Seeds. There are enemies that attack the location every now and then, but the NPCs will usually stop them from reaching the farm, freeing you to focus on farming and not fighting. The nodes are also very condensed, making the farm quick. </p>



<p>I suggest parking your alts here and quickly picking up the 7-8 flax nodes every day. Unless you&#8217;re looking to maximize your daily return on Flax, parking your alts here and gathering daily will get you plenty of Flax with minimal time investment.</p>



<p>To reach this Flax farm location, take the Jaka Itzel waypoint in Verdant Brink. Jump over the edge and glide all the way down, slightly north-east of the waypoint.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A little out of the way: <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pride_of_the_Pact">Soulkeeper&#8217;s Airship Waypoint</a> (Bloodstone Fen)</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/flax-farm-bloodstone-map.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/flax-farm-bloodstone-map-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-749"/></a><figcaption><em><a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pride_of_the_Pact">Airship Waypoint</a> &#8211; Bloodstone Fen</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This Flax Seed farm is a bit spread out, but still pretty efficient. There are 8 Flax nodes spread out on three floating islands in Bloodstone Fen. There are a few enemies near these nodes, but they won&#8217;t pose much of a threat. Getting to these location will require at least the <strong>Updraft </strong>mastery. <strong>Ley Line Gliding</strong> can make this run even faster, but is not needed. This also takes you to the diving goggles that are a great place to farm <strong>Unbound Magic</strong> daily.</p>



<p>There are three floating islands that contain Flax nodes. Aim for the two on the northern part of the map first. From Soulkeeper&#8217;s Airship Waypoint, use the updrafts (or the Ley Line if you have the mastery) to make your way to the small grass covered floating islands to the north-east of the airship. From there, you can glide down to the top of the large grassy island. Once you harvest the flax nodes there, drop off the northern edge of the island to find the last two nodes.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">An annoying defender: <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heathen%27s_Hold">Heathen&#8217;s Hold Waypoint</a> (Draconis Mons)</h3>

<p>This spot has a good amount of Flax that is relatively compact. However, there are a few enemies that may interrupt your harvest. The main issue here is that a group event boss can spawn in this area, making it difficult to collect the nodes until it is defeated.</p>



<p>To get to this spot, go to the Heathen&#8217;s Hold Waypoint in Draconis Mons. From there, jump off the western cliff where the three unbound magic nodes are. Fall straight through the three unbound magics and glide to the lower ledge sticking out. From this cliff, enter the cave back to the east. The farm location is at the end of the right path of the cave.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A tough fight: <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Order_of_Whispers_Camp">Order of Whispers Camp Waypoint</a> (Tangled Depths)</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/flax-farm-tangled-map.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/flax-farm-tangled-map-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-761"/></a><figcaption><em><a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Order_of_Whispers_Camp">Order of Whispers Camp Waypoint</a> OR Ogre Camp Waypoint &#8211; Tangled Depths</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This group of Flax nodes is protected by some tough enemies. It is also a bit of a pain to get to. You will need the <strong>Updraft</strong> mastery or a <strong>Springer</strong> mount to make it to this spot.</p>



<p>From Order of Whispers Camp Waypoint in Tangled Depths, head toward the open area full of updrafts. Either use those updrafts or your Springer to make it to the south-eastern upper ledge. If using your Springer, climb up the eastern wall toward the Vista. If using updrafts, start at the southern wall. Stay to the left at the fork to make it to the open area with the flax. There are also two chests nearby that can be looted while you are here. </p>



<p>You can also reach this area by using your Springer from the Ogre Camp Waypoint, but the jumps are tough.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">All over the place: <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reclaimed_Chantry">Reclaimed Chantry Waypoint</a> (Jahai Bluffs)</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/flax-farm-jahai-map.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/flax-farm-jahai-map-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-764"/></a><figcaption><em><a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reclaimed_Chantry">Reclaimed Chantry Waypoint </a>&#8211; Jahai Bluffs</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This &#8220;spot&#8221; is more of an area. There are multiple flax nodes to find in the Jungle Anomaly of Jahai Bluffs. Most of them are in the upper area of the jungle. To get to them, you will need a <strong>Springer </strong>or the <strong>Bouncing Mushrooms</strong> mastery. You&#8217;ll have to contend with Chakk, so the Chakk mastery is helpful but not necessary. </p>



<p>To get there from the Reclaimed Chantry Waypoint, head south and turn west. Go through the cave to the west. Continue heading west through the Branded area until you make it to the Jungle Anomaly. Once in the anomaly, use your Springer or the bouncing mushrooms to make it up to the higher area. There are flax nodes throughout this area.</p>
