										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Constellations are a major part of your character&#8217;s power in Genshin Impact. This guide will teach you everything you need to know about what they do and how to unlock them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Are Constellations</h2>



<p>Constellations in Genshin Impact are generally passive bonuses to Talents. Talents, in comparison, add new functionality to your character. There are two types of Talents: <strong>Combat Talents</strong> and <strong>Passive Talents</strong>. Constellations generally make a specific <strong>Combat Talent more effective</strong>.</p>



<p>The effect Constellations have on Talents varies. They can increase damage, increase range, reduce cooldown, or otherwise augment your existing Combat Talents. You can check out this link to the wiki for <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Characters">every character&#8217;s Constellation</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/constellation.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="839" src="/wp-content/uploads/constellation-1024x839.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8980" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/constellation-1024x839.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/constellation-300x246.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/constellation-768x629.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/constellation.jpg 1077w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Constellations must be unlocked in order from top to bottom</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Other than the main character, the Traveler, every character has six Constellation nodes that can be unlocked, each with their own benefits. The Traveler also has Constellations, but they work a bit differently. Click the Spoiler below to see the difference. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Stella Fortuna &#8211; How To Unlock Constellations</h2>



<p>A character&#8217;s <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Stella_Fortuna">Stella Fortuna</a> unlocks Constellation nodes. These tokens are specific to the character, meaning that they cannot be used on other characters. Acquiring a duplicate of a character you already posses gives you a Stella Fortuna for that character. You can earn duplicates in multiple ways, primarily through the game&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game">gacha </a>Wish system. Check out our guide on <a href="https://marvweb.com/wish-system-characters/">acquiring characters</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Each Stella Fortuna you earn for a character allows you to unlock one of their six Constellation nodes. This means you will need to <strong>acquire a character seven times</strong> to unlock every Constellation node. </p>



<p>To unlock a Constellation, go to the Character screen. Select &#8220;Constellation&#8221; to see the list of Constellation nodes for this character. While you can view each one, you will need to<strong> unlock them in order</strong> from top to bottom. Select the first locked Constellation and then press &#8220;Activate&#8221; to use your Stella Fortuna. This will permanently unlock this node for this character. Once unlocked, Constellations do not need to be activated; they will <strong>always be active</strong> once you have acquired them. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/traveller-constellation.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="606" src="/wp-content/uploads/traveller-constellation-1024x606.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9413" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/traveller-constellation-1024x606.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/traveller-constellation-300x178.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/traveller-constellation-768x455.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/traveller-constellation.png 1439w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The Traveler&#8217;s Constellation</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Constellations are the <strong>only use for Stella Fortuna</strong>. Therefore, once you acquire a Stella Fortuna, there is no downside to spending it on your character. Once you have acquired six Stella Fortuna for a character, you will no longer receive more from duplicates. Instead, duplicates will earn you additional <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Masterless_Starglitter">Masterless Starglitter</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Traveler Difference</h3>



<p>The Traveler uses <strong>Memories </strong>instead of Stella Fortuna to unlock their Constellation nodes, but the concept is pretty much the same. Main Quests, Adventure Rank rewards, and the Souvenir Shop are the current ways to obtain Memories. Click the Spoiler below for a bit more information about the difference between the Traveler and other characters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Genshin Impact is a Free to Play game that makes most of its money from slot machine &#8220;<em><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gacha">gacha</a></em>&#8221; type microtransactions. The biggest attraction to these gacha games are that they are the best way to obtain new characters. This guide will tell you all you need to know about unlocking new characters in Genshin Impact.</p>



<p><em>There will be <strong>no</strong> story spoilers in this guide.</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-vivid-purple-color has-css-opacity has-vivid-purple-background-color has-background"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Differences Between Four and Five Star Characters</h2>



<p>I feel that it is important to preface this guide with a clarification on character star ratings. There are two different star ratings for characters: Four Star and Five Star. These ratings only depict the rarity of the character, <strong>NOT the power</strong>. There is only one version of any character, so if you have a character, you have the best version of that character. </p>



<p>While some characters may feel stronger than others, each character has unique abilities and passives. You may find that a team of Four Star characters are better for you than a team of Five Stars, depending on your playstyle. For a list of every character and their rarity, check out the <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Characters">wiki article on characters</a>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-vivid-purple-color has-css-opacity has-vivid-purple-background-color has-background"/>

</script>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Free Story Characters</h2>



<p>By simply progressing the main story quests, you will unlock a <strong>total of four characters</strong>. Your main character, the <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler">Traveler</a>, is unlocked from the start. As you complete some of the introductory quests, you will progressively unlock three more characters. Once you have a full team of four from story quests,<strong> you will no longer obtain characters through quests.</strong></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-vivid-purple-color has-css-opacity has-vivid-purple-background-color has-background"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left">Wish System</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="126" height="114" src="/wp-content/uploads/wish-button.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9467"/></figure>



<p>Shortly into the story, before unlocking all free story characters, you will unlock the Wish system. This gacha system is the best way to unlock new characters. Select the Wish icon in the Main Menu in game (Paimon&#8217;s Menu). </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Types of Wishes</h3>



<p>There are two main types of wishes: <strong>Standard Wishes</strong> and <strong>Event Wishes</strong>. Standard Wishes are the normal type of Wish that you can purchase at any time. Event Wishes only last for a set duration before being replaced. You can see the &#8220;Time Remaining&#8221; of Event Wishes in the Wish menu.</p>



<p>Both types of Wish have their own currency for purchasing. One Standard Wish is purchased with one <strong><a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Acquaint_Fate">Acquaint Fate</a></strong>. One Event Wish is purchased with one <strong><a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Intertwined_Fate">Intertwined Fate</a></strong>. These currencies have no other use other than purchasing their corresponding Wish. </p>



<p>There are also <strong>Beginners&#8217; Wishes</strong> which can only be purchased 20 times. These Wishes are at a 20% Fate discount and guarantee a specific character (Noelle at the time of writing this) within the first 10 set. After you have bought all 20 Beginners&#8217; Wishes, you will not be able to buy them again.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Purchasing Fates</h3>



<p>Acquaint Fates and Intertwined Fates are primarily obtained through the Shop, though a few Fates can be earned in certain quests. Access the Shop through the Main Menu. Select &#8220;<strong>Paimon&#8217;s Bargains&#8221;</strong> to see the exchange of Primogems to Fates. Both types of Fate cost the same &#8211; <strong>160 <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Primogem">Primogems</a></strong>. Fates can also be purchased with <strong><a href="#starglitter">Masterless Starglitter</a></strong> earned from duplicates.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/fate-symbols.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="579" height="267" src="/wp-content/uploads/fate-symbols.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9050" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/fate-symbols.png 579w, /wp-content/uploads/fate-symbols-300x138.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 579px) 100vw, 579px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Fates Can Be Purchased in the Shop For 160 Primogems</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Primogems are earned through normal gameplay and exploration. Primogems can also be earned indefinitely through daily rewards. Finally, Primogems can be purchased using the Premium Currency, <strong><a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Genesis_Crystal">Genesis Crystals</a></strong>. </p>



<p>Genesis Crystals are purchased in the Shop, under the tab &#8220;<strong>Crystal Top-Up</strong>.&#8221; Genesis Crystals have a one-to-one exchange rate for Primogems, which can then be spent on Fates.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/crystals-to-primogems.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="810" height="579" src="/wp-content/uploads/crystals-to-primogems.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8984" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/crystals-to-primogems.png 810w, /wp-content/uploads/crystals-to-primogems-300x214.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/crystals-to-primogems-768x549.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Genesis Crystals have a One-to-One Exchange Rate with Primogems </em></figcaption></figure>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Odds of Wishes</h3>



<p>You can view the possible contents of a Wish by selecting &#8220;<strong>Details</strong>&#8221; on the Wish screen with the Wish selected. Each Wish has a different chance of containing different characters and items. </p>



<p>There is also a <strong>Wish Guarantee</strong> that will ensure you get at least one rare character or item after enough Wishes. You will get at least one Four Star or higher character or items for every 10 Wishes you buy. You will get at least one Five Star character or items for every 90 Wishes you buy. These Guarantees are reset each time you obtain the corresponding pull. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/wish-chances.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1016" height="116" src="/wp-content/uploads/wish-chances.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9468" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/wish-chances.jpg 1016w, /wp-content/uploads/wish-chances-300x34.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/wish-chances-768x88.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1016px) 100vw, 1016px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Chances for Each Rarity Rating &#8211; Shown in the Details</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Which Wish Should You Buy</h3>



<p>First, if you have not purchased all of your Beginners&#8217; Wishes, buy them first. They are cheaper than the others and give you a great character to start with that fills a roll that the free story characters do not.</p>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve purchased all of your Beginners&#8217; Wishes, you&#8217;re left with two choices. Event and Standard Wishes cost the same number of Primogems, so you should decide which one is more valuable to you.</p>



<p>Generally, certain rare (Five Star) characters and items can only be obtained by their corresponding Event Wish. The Event Wish can also contain the characters and items that Standard Wishes do. Since Event Wishes are a limited time, unless you do not want the current Event characters or items, the Event Wish is usually the better option. </p>



<p>That said, if you want a specific character or item that the Standard Wish drops and have no need for the current Event Wishes, purchasing a Standard Wish will give you the highest chance of getting that pull.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Duplicate Characters</h3>



<p>A Wish can contain a character you already have. If it does, you will not obtain a second copy of that character. Instead, the pull will be converted to a <strong><a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Stella_Fortuna">Stella Fortuna</a></strong> specifically for that character. You will also receive <strong>Masterless Starglitter</strong> depending on the rarity of the character: 10 for Five Star characters, 2 for Four Star characters. </p>



<p>Stella Fortunas are used to unlock <strong><a href="/constellations/">Constellations </a></strong>for a character, further increasing that character&#8217;s effectiveness. If you have earned the maximum number of Stella Fortunas for a character, you will instead receive additional Masterless Starglitter: a total of 25 for Five Star and a total of 5 for Four Star. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Other Ways of Earning Characters</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="starglitter">Masterless Starglitter</h3>



<p>The Masterless Starglitter you earn from duplicates obtained through the Wish system can be used to <strong>deterministically purchase characters and items</strong>. In the Shop, select &#8220;Paimon&#8217;s Bargains&#8221; and then &#8220;Starglitter Exchange&#8221; to see which characters can currently be purchased. </p>



<p>The selections of characters and items will <strong>cycle every month</strong>. The current duration of these purchases can be seen in the top left of the screen. You will only be able to purchase a set amount of each character or item until they are reset. The number of remaining purchases is shown under the character or item.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Events</h3>



<p>You can earn characters through Events. You can see the current Events by selecting its icon in the Main Menu. Completing the Event challenge will earn you the character shown.</p>
