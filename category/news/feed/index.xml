<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Prime Resurgence</h2>



<p>Prime Resurgence is an event in Warframe that will temporarily replace the existing Vaulted Relic system for Prime parts. Instead of earning the current &#8220;unvaulted&#8221; relics from missions in the void, Tenno will instead earn a new currency, Aya, that can be spent on vaulted relics. The relics available to be purchased will change each week of the event.</p>



<p>You will also be able to purchase a premium version of Aya, Regal Aya, for real money. This premium currency can be spent to purchase the Prime weapons and warframes outright instead of going through the normal relic process. It can also be used to purchase items given out as part of the Amazon Prime &#8220;Prime Gaming&#8221; program. Regal Aya will not be earnable in game, cannot be purchased with Platinum, and cannot be traded; the only way to get Regal Aya is to buy it. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When is  Prime Resurgence </h2>



<p>Prime Resurgence will be available from <strong>November 16th, 2021</strong> until <strong>January 25th, 2022</strong>. Each week will feature a different pair of Prime Warframes and their associated Prime weapons. The schedule is as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Nov. 16 &#8211; Nov. 22: Mag &amp; Nova  </li>



<li>Nov. 23 &#8211; Nov. 29: Limbo &amp; Trinity</li>



<li>Nov. 30 &#8211; Dec. 06: Mesa &amp; Hydroid</li>



<li>Dec. 07 &#8211; Dec. 13: Volt &amp; Loki</li>



<li>Dec. 14 &#8211; Dec. 20: Vauban &amp; Ash</li>



<li>Dec. 21 &#8211; Dec. 27: Oberon &amp; Nekros</li>



<li>Dec. 28 &#8211; Jan. 03: Valkyr &amp; Saryn</li>



<li>Jan. 04 &#8211; Jan. 10: Ember &amp; Frost</li>

<li>Jan. 18 &#8211; Jan. 25: Ash, Vauban, Nekros, Oberon, Saryn, Valkyr, Ember, &amp; Frost</li>
</ul>



<p>The final two weeks of the event will be a last chance to participate in the event, likely offering multiple Primes that were offered in previous weeks.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Farm Aya</h2>



<p>Aya will replace &#8220;unvaulted&#8221; relics during the event, meaning that doing missions in the Void and Bounties on Cetus/Fortuna/Necralisk has a chance to earn you the new currency. The amount of Aya you earn is not dependent upon the era of the relic; you earn one Aya for every vaulted Axi, Neo, Meso, and Lith relic you would have otherwise gotten. Since you can buy the Axi relics for one Aya, this essentially means you can trade a vaulted Lith for a vaulted Axi &#8211; a good trade! </p>



<p>Spamming short Void missions like Hepit, Ukko, or Marduk is the most effective way of farming Aya, but there is some luck involved since you will only earn Aya if you would have normally gotten a vaulted relic. Since relic rarity doesn&#8217;t seem to matter, The Capture missions are the better choice. <strong>Hepit will be the fastest way to farm</strong>, with Ukko being only slightly behind it because of the increased enemy level. As with most Capture mission farms, if you mission changes to an Exterminate, it is often faster to leave and restart the mission.</p>



<p>Bounties are also a good way to earn Aya, but these missions will take much longer to complete. Choose to do bounties if you need reputation with the associated faction or other items that come from bounties. If you are just looking to maximize Aya, Void missions are better.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Spend Aya</h2>



<p>Aya can be spent at Varzia who is located in Maroo&#8217;s Bazaar on Mars during the event. In addition to the current offering of vaulted relics, you can also purchase Syandanas, Orbiter skins, Sigils, Glyphs, and Ducats.</p>

</script>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Lore of Aya</h2>



<p>Varzia describes Aya as an &#8220;Orokin sequencing medium.&#8221; This means that Aya is a type of storage material used by the Orokin. The Orokin used Aya in Ayatan Statues to record many of their violent acts. Varzia is happy that Maroo is melting down these statues and erasing the terrible history of the Orokin. She believes that the Prime Warframe data held within should be retained though.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but think of a particular Twitch emote when seeing the name though&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/q2gooi/twitchtv_got_leaked_like_the_entire_website/hfl3tyu/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">recent leak of popular streaming site Twitch.tv</a> has put the entire source code of how the site works out on the internet for everyone to see, comments and all. One of the first things that peaked people&#8217;s attention was to finally see behind the curtain of how Twitch assigns the elusive &#8220;Golden Kappa.&#8221; Per the source code, it seems that Golden Kappa is not as random as people believed.</p>



<script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4537180102637521" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4537180102637521" data-ad-slot="5280630734"></ins>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the Golden Kappa</h2>



<p>For those not in-the-know, &#8220;Golden Kappa&#8221; refers to a Golden version of a well known emote on Twitch. The normal emote, Kappa, is one of the most well-known emotes on the site. It is often used to convey a sense of sarcasm, much like &#8220;/s&#8221; is used on other social sites. The basic Kappa emote is a greyscale picture of Josh DeSeno, a programmer for Justin.tv, the early version of Twitch. As the name implies, &#8220;Golden Kappa&#8221; is the same picture with a golden look rather than the greyscale. The golden version is also only two colors, making it flatter and appear a bit more as an award of sorts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/golden-kappa.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="356" height="253" src="/wp-content/uploads/golden-kappa.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9089" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/golden-kappa.jpg 356w, /wp-content/uploads/golden-kappa-300x213.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kappa (left) vs Golden Kappa (right)</figcaption></figure>



<p>While every user can use the global emote Kappa anywhere on Twitch, only a select few could use the golden version, and only for a short time. Prior to the leak, it was generally believed that every day, a select few users were randomly chosen as the Golden Kappas for the day. When these select users typed the Kappa emote into a chat, it would produce the golden version instead of the standard greyscale. </p>



<p>There was no notification or any indication that a user had been awarded access to the Golden Kappa. The only way to know that you were chosen was to type Kappa into chat. This led many to often do &#8220;Golden Kappa Checks,&#8221; where viewers of a stream would all spam the Kappa emote to see if any of them had been lucky enough to win the roll for that day.</p>

</script>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Does the Golden Kappa Actually Work</h2>



<p>The code snippet shown here implies that a list of specific users are able to assign the Golden Kappa to anyone they want. It may be that there is another part of the code that assigns it randomly, but even if that is true, these users can assign additional Golden Kappas at their own discretion. As was speculated, the duration for how long a user is awarded the Golden Kappa is 24 hours.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/golden-kappa-code-snippetJPG.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="420" height="456" src="/wp-content/uploads/golden-kappa-code-snippetJPG.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9091" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/golden-kappa-code-snippetJPG.jpg 420w, /wp-content/uploads/golden-kappa-code-snippetJPG-276x300.jpg 276w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Code Snippet From &#8220;goldenkappa.go&#8221;</figcaption></figure>



<p>The leak has demystified a niche but exciting aspect of Twitch. What was once believed to be a free lottery that every user was entered into daily has instead been shown to simply be an award a select few users can hand out to whoever they like. While it still could be true that the Golden Kappa is relatively random, knowing that it is decided by bias prone humans instead of dispassionate code makes it a lot less exciting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1236257-update-295-deimos-arcana/">Patch 29.5, Deimos Arcana</a>, adds new content to Warframe. This content patch comes with a new Necramech, changes to Steel Essence acquisition, new weapons including Infested Kitguns, and many other small changes. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="bonewidow-necramech">Bonewidow Necramech</h2>



<p>Unlike the Voidrig, the second Necramech to be added to the game is focused on <strong>melee</strong>. The <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Bonewidow">Bonewidow </a>has an exalted melee weapon as its fourth ability, and its other abilities are also focused on melee. </p>



<p>Its blueprints can be acquired from the <a href="/warframe/deimos/necraloid-syndicate/">Necraloid Syndicate</a>, with the main blueprint obtainable at max rank (Rank 3: Odima) for <strong>10,000 standing</strong> and the <strong>four </strong>component blueprints requiring <strong>3,500 standing each</strong>. The component blueprints will require damaged parts obtained from <a href="/warframe/deimos/isolation-vaults/">isolation vaults</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="infested-kitguns">Infested Kitguns</h2>



<p>Infested Kitguns are primary and secondary weapons that are built from components just like their Fortuna counterparts. There are new Infested style <strong>chambers, grips, and loaders</strong>. These parts can be purchased from <a href="/warframe/deimos/entrati-syndicate#father">Father</a> for Entrati Standing. Once purchased, talk with Rude Zudd in Fortuna to put the gun together. You can mix and match Kitgun components from Fortuna too. Check out the <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Kitgun#Primary">Kitgun page on the wiki</a> for more specifics on each part.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="steel-path-incursions">Steel Path Incursions</h2>



<p>Deimos Arcana adds a <strong>new way to acquire Steel Essence</strong>. Every day there will be five Steel Path incursions that will reward Steel Essence when completed. These missions will be available to everyone who has access to the Steel Path, even if the node has not been unlocked, helping with matchmaking. </p>



<p>In addition, any Steel Path mission can now spawn Acolytes. These Acolytes will drop two Steel Essences when defeated, but will run away if they down you. Teshin&#8217;s inventory has been updated with new wares to spend Steel Essence on, including rare items like <strong>Umbra Forma</strong> blueprints.</p>



<p>Check out our <a href="/warframe/steel-path/">Steel Path guide</a> for tips on this difficult game mode.</p>

<p>Deimos Arcana focuses a lot on changes to <a href="/warframe/deimos/isolation-vaults/">Isolation Vaults</a>, adding four new ruins. New items gave been added as rewards for isolation vaults. There are also some new encounters in isolation vaults, offering some variety for extended runs. The <strong>speed of Loid has been increased</strong>, while his health has been decreased. Scintillants inside the vaults now have a chance to respawn, so if you get the same vault on an extended run, you can still get more. </p>



<p>You now have a chance to fight the new Bonewidow Necramech instead of just the normal Voidrig. The difficulty of these enemy Necramechs has also been adjusted by giving them many of the <strong>characteristics of Kuva Liches</strong>, like diminishing returns on status effects instead of immunity. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="entrati-syndicate-changes-in-deimos-arcana">Entrati Syndicate Changes in Deimos Arcana</h2>



<p>In addition to the items that have been added as part of this patch, the <a href="/warframe/deimos/entrati-syndicate/">Entrati Syndicate</a> has had some other small changes. You can now obtain every family member&#8217;s tokens from Grandmother through her new &#8220;Mend the Family&#8221; option. This gives an alternate way to obtain tokens other than engaging with that specific family member&#8217;s content. </p>



<p>There is a new evergreen use for <a href="/warframe/deimos/necraloid-syndicate/">Necraloid Syndicate</a> standing. You can now exchange <strong>50,000 Necraloid Standing</strong> for a Ayatan Sculpture with a base value of 450 Endo. With four Cyan and one Amber Ayatan installed, it has a value of <strong>3000 Endo</strong>. </p>



<p>Two new mods have been added to Sons inventory. Martyr Symbiosis gives Vulpaphyla the ability to store health from enemy deaths and heal their master. Volatile Parasite spawns a parasite that attaches to enemies, forcing other enemies to attack it.</p>
