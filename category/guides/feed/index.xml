					<description><![CDATA[Learn how to get to the Crown Tundra and start your legendary adventure in Pokemon Sword and Shield's second expansion.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <a href="https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/the-crown-tundra/">Crown Tundra</a> is the second expansion for Pokemon Sword and Shield. It includes a whole new zone to explore south of the original zone. It is full of returning Pokemon from previous games, including legendries. This guide will show you how to get to the Crown Tundra.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Purchase the Crown Tundra Expansion</h2>



<p>The Crown Tundra is paid DLC for Pokemon Sword and Shield. To go to the new area, you will need to buy the expansion. The easiest way to do this is through the Nintendo eShop, but this will require an internet connection. You do not need the paid service, Nintendo Switch Online, to make this purchase. </p>



<p>You can navigate to the purchase page in multiple ways. Opening the Nintendo eShop through the Switch homepage and searching for Pokemon Sword or Pokemon Shield will take you to their respective pages. You can also press the &#8220;+&#8221; button on the icon for Sword or Shield to bring up its menu. Under &#8220;Software Information&#8221; select &#8220;Nintendo eShop.&#8221;</p>



<p>From the main page for the version of the game you own, scroll down to see the DLCs available for purchase. Currently, you cannot buy the Crown Tundra on its own; you will have to purchase the Expansion Pass that also includes<a href="https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/the-isle-of-armor/"> Isle of Armor</a>.</p>



<p>You can also purchase physical copies of the game plus the expansion pass at Nintendo&#8217;s website for both <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/pokemon-sword-and-pokemon-sword-expansion-pass-switch/">Sword </a>and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/pokemon-shield-and-pokemon-shield-expansion-pass-switch/">Shield</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Go to the Wedgehurst Train Station</h2>



<p>Once you have purchased the expansion, you will receive a notification upon loading into the game that you are ready to set off to the Crown Tundra. You will also receive a &#8220;Crown Pass&#8221; key item that allows you to select the new destination at the train station. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/access-crown-tundra-pass.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="706" height="574" src="/wp-content/uploads/access-crown-tundra-pass.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8214" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/access-crown-tundra-pass.jpg 706w, /wp-content/uploads/access-crown-tundra-pass-300x244.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px" /></a></figure>



<p>Similar to the Isle of Armor, you will need to go to the Wedgehurt Train Station. This is the first city that you encountered in the story, just north of Route 01. The train station is on the southern part of the city. Once inside, present you Crown Pass to the ticket NPC and select the Crown Tundra Station. If you haven&#8217;t yet done the opening to Isle of Armor, you will have to catch the slowpoke first. </p>



<p>Upon arriving, you Pokedex will be updated with all of the new Crown Tundra specific Pokemon. Just leave the station and start your legendary adventure!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Learn everything you need to know about Constellations in Genshin Impact including how to unlock them and what they do.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Constellations are a major part of your character&#8217;s power in Genshin Impact. This guide will teach you everything you need to know about what they do and how to unlock them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Are Constellations</h2>



<p>Constellations in Genshin Impact are generally passive bonuses to Talents. Talents, in comparison, add new functionality to your character. There are two types of Talents: <strong>Combat Talents</strong> and <strong>Passive Talents</strong>. Constellations generally make a specific <strong>Combat Talent more effective</strong>.</p>



<p>The effect Constellations have on Talents varies. They can increase damage, increase range, reduce cooldown, or otherwise augment your existing Combat Talents. You can check out this link to the wiki for <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Characters">every character&#8217;s Constellation</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/constellation.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="839" src="/wp-content/uploads/constellation-1024x839.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8980" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/constellation-1024x839.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/constellation-300x246.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/constellation-768x629.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/constellation.jpg 1077w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Constellations must be unlocked in order from top to bottom</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Other than the main character, the Traveler, every character has six Constellation nodes that can be unlocked, each with their own benefits. The Traveler also has Constellations, but they work a bit differently. Click the Spoiler below to see the difference. </p>

Currently, the Traveler can only pick Anemo and Geo, meaning that they have access to two sets of six Constellation nodes for a total of twelve. This will likely increase in the future as the Traveler unlocks more elements.</div><noscript><div class="spoiler-body">The Traveler has a different Constellation for each of their elements.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Stella Fortuna &#8211; How To Unlock Constellations</h2>



<p>A character&#8217;s <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Stella_Fortuna">Stella Fortuna</a> unlocks Constellation nodes. These tokens are specific to the character, meaning that they cannot be used on other characters. Acquiring a duplicate of a character you already posses gives you a Stella Fortuna for that character. You can earn duplicates in multiple ways, primarily through the game&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game">gacha </a>Wish system. Check out our guide on <a href="https://marvweb.com/wish-system-characters/">acquiring characters</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Each Stella Fortuna you earn for a character allows you to unlock one of their six Constellation nodes. This means you will need to <strong>acquire a character seven times</strong> to unlock every Constellation node. </p>



<p>To unlock a Constellation, go to the Character screen. Select &#8220;Constellation&#8221; to see the list of Constellation nodes for this character. While you can view each one, you will need to<strong> unlock them in order</strong> from top to bottom. Select the first locked Constellation and then press &#8220;Activate&#8221; to use your Stella Fortuna. This will permanently unlock this node for this character. Once unlocked, Constellations do not need to be activated; they will <strong>always be active</strong> once you have acquired them. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/traveller-constellation.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="606" src="/wp-content/uploads/traveller-constellation-1024x606.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9413" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/traveller-constellation-1024x606.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/traveller-constellation-300x178.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/traveller-constellation-768x455.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/traveller-constellation.png 1439w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The Traveler&#8217;s Constellation</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Constellations are the <strong>only use for Stella Fortuna</strong>. Therefore, once you acquire a Stella Fortuna, there is no downside to spending it on your character. Once you have acquired six Stella Fortuna for a character, you will no longer receive more from duplicates. Instead, duplicates will earn you additional <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Masterless_Starglitter">Masterless Starglitter</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Traveler Difference</h3>



<p>The Traveler uses <strong>Memories </strong>instead of Stella Fortuna to unlock their Constellation nodes, but the concept is pretty much the same. Main Quests, Adventure Rank rewards, and the Souvenir Shop are the current ways to obtain Memories. Click the Spoiler below for a bit more information about the difference between the Traveler and other characters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Genshin Impact is a Free to Play game that makes most of its money from slot machine &#8220;<em><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gacha">gacha</a></em>&#8221; type microtransactions. The biggest attraction to these gacha games are that they are the best way to obtain new characters. This guide will tell you all you need to know about unlocking new characters in Genshin Impact.</p>



<p><em>There will be <strong>no</strong> story spoilers in this guide.</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-vivid-purple-color has-css-opacity has-vivid-purple-background-color has-background"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Differences Between Four and Five Star Characters</h2>



<p>I feel that it is important to preface this guide with a clarification on character star ratings. There are two different star ratings for characters: Four Star and Five Star. These ratings only depict the rarity of the character, <strong>NOT the power</strong>. There is only one version of any character, so if you have a character, you have the best version of that character. </p>



<p>While some characters may feel stronger than others, each character has unique abilities and passives. You may find that a team of Four Star characters are better for you than a team of Five Stars, depending on your playstyle. For a list of every character and their rarity, check out the <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Characters">wiki article on characters</a>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-vivid-purple-color has-css-opacity has-vivid-purple-background-color has-background"/>



<script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4537180102637521" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4537180102637521" data-ad-slot="5280630734"></ins>

</script>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Free Story Characters</h2>



<p>By simply progressing the main story quests, you will unlock a <strong>total of four characters</strong>. Your main character, the <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler">Traveler</a>, is unlocked from the start. As you complete some of the introductory quests, you will progressively unlock three more characters. Once you have a full team of four from story quests,<strong> you will no longer obtain characters through quests.</strong></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-vivid-purple-color has-css-opacity has-vivid-purple-background-color has-background"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left">Wish System</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="126" height="114" src="/wp-content/uploads/wish-button.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9467"/></figure>



<p>Shortly into the story, before unlocking all free story characters, you will unlock the Wish system. This gacha system is the best way to unlock new characters. Select the Wish icon in the Main Menu in game (Paimon&#8217;s Menu). </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Types of Wishes</h3>



<p>There are two main types of wishes: <strong>Standard Wishes</strong> and <strong>Event Wishes</strong>. Standard Wishes are the normal type of Wish that you can purchase at any time. Event Wishes only last for a set duration before being replaced. You can see the &#8220;Time Remaining&#8221; of Event Wishes in the Wish menu.</p>



<p>Both types of Wish have their own currency for purchasing. One Standard Wish is purchased with one <strong><a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Acquaint_Fate">Acquaint Fate</a></strong>. One Event Wish is purchased with one <strong><a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Intertwined_Fate">Intertwined Fate</a></strong>. These currencies have no other use other than purchasing their corresponding Wish. </p>



<p>There are also <strong>Beginners&#8217; Wishes</strong> which can only be purchased 20 times. These Wishes are at a 20% Fate discount and guarantee a specific character (Noelle at the time of writing this) within the first 10 set. After you have bought all 20 Beginners&#8217; Wishes, you will not be able to buy them again.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Purchasing Fates</h3>



<p>Acquaint Fates and Intertwined Fates are primarily obtained through the Shop, though a few Fates can be earned in certain quests. Access the Shop through the Main Menu. Select &#8220;<strong>Paimon&#8217;s Bargains&#8221;</strong> to see the exchange of Primogems to Fates. Both types of Fate cost the same &#8211; <strong>160 <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Primogem">Primogems</a></strong>. Fates can also be purchased with <strong><a href="#starglitter">Masterless Starglitter</a></strong> earned from duplicates.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/fate-symbols.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="579" height="267" src="/wp-content/uploads/fate-symbols.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9050" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/fate-symbols.png 579w, /wp-content/uploads/fate-symbols-300x138.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 579px) 100vw, 579px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Fates Can Be Purchased in the Shop For 160 Primogems</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Primogems are earned through normal gameplay and exploration. Primogems can also be earned indefinitely through daily rewards. Finally, Primogems can be purchased using the Premium Currency, <strong><a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Genesis_Crystal">Genesis Crystals</a></strong>. </p>



<p>Genesis Crystals are purchased in the Shop, under the tab &#8220;<strong>Crystal Top-Up</strong>.&#8221; Genesis Crystals have a one-to-one exchange rate for Primogems, which can then be spent on Fates.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/crystals-to-primogems.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="810" height="579" src="/wp-content/uploads/crystals-to-primogems.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8984" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/crystals-to-primogems.png 810w, /wp-content/uploads/crystals-to-primogems-300x214.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/crystals-to-primogems-768x549.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Genesis Crystals have a One-to-One Exchange Rate with Primogems </em></figcaption></figure>

</script>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Odds of Wishes</h3>



<p>You can view the possible contents of a Wish by selecting &#8220;<strong>Details</strong>&#8221; on the Wish screen with the Wish selected. Each Wish has a different chance of containing different characters and items. </p>



<p>There is also a <strong>Wish Guarantee</strong> that will ensure you get at least one rare character or item after enough Wishes. You will get at least one Four Star or higher character or items for every 10 Wishes you buy. You will get at least one Five Star character or items for every 90 Wishes you buy. These Guarantees are reset each time you obtain the corresponding pull. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/wish-chances.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1016" height="116" src="/wp-content/uploads/wish-chances.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9468" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/wish-chances.jpg 1016w, /wp-content/uploads/wish-chances-300x34.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/wish-chances-768x88.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1016px) 100vw, 1016px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Chances for Each Rarity Rating &#8211; Shown in the Details</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Which Wish Should You Buy</h3>



<p>First, if you have not purchased all of your Beginners&#8217; Wishes, buy them first. They are cheaper than the others and give you a great character to start with that fills a roll that the free story characters do not.</p>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve purchased all of your Beginners&#8217; Wishes, you&#8217;re left with two choices. Event and Standard Wishes cost the same number of Primogems, so you should decide which one is more valuable to you.</p>



<p>Generally, certain rare (Five Star) characters and items can only be obtained by their corresponding Event Wish. The Event Wish can also contain the characters and items that Standard Wishes do. Since Event Wishes are a limited time, unless you do not want the current Event characters or items, the Event Wish is usually the better option. </p>



<p>That said, if you want a specific character or item that the Standard Wish drops and have no need for the current Event Wishes, purchasing a Standard Wish will give you the highest chance of getting that pull.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Duplicate Characters</h3>



<p>A Wish can contain a character you already have. If it does, you will not obtain a second copy of that character. Instead, the pull will be converted to a <strong><a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Stella_Fortuna">Stella Fortuna</a></strong> specifically for that character. You will also receive <strong>Masterless Starglitter</strong> depending on the rarity of the character: 10 for Five Star characters, 2 for Four Star characters. </p>



<p>Stella Fortunas are used to unlock <strong><a href="/constellations/">Constellations </a></strong>for a character, further increasing that character&#8217;s effectiveness. If you have earned the maximum number of Stella Fortunas for a character, you will instead receive additional Masterless Starglitter: a total of 25 for Five Star and a total of 5 for Four Star. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Other Ways of Earning Characters</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="starglitter">Masterless Starglitter</h3>



<p>The Masterless Starglitter you earn from duplicates obtained through the Wish system can be used to <strong>deterministically purchase characters and items</strong>. In the Shop, select &#8220;Paimon&#8217;s Bargains&#8221; and then &#8220;Starglitter Exchange&#8221; to see which characters can currently be purchased. </p>



<p>The selections of characters and items will <strong>cycle every month</strong>. The current duration of these purchases can be seen in the top left of the screen. You will only be able to purchase a set amount of each character or item until they are reset. The number of remaining purchases is shown under the character or item.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Learn the best way to win the Brewfest Chowdown during Brewfest in World of Warcraft and earn your Brewfest Chowdown Trophy toy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During the Brewfest holiday, you can earn a Toy called the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=169865/brewfest-chowdown-trophy">Brewfest Chowdown Trophy</a> by winning the Brewfest Chowdown competition five times. This competition will pit you against three other players, so you&#8217;ll need a sound strategy to pull ahead.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Participate in the Brewfest Chowdown</h2>



<p>You&#8217;ll find Etga, the Chowdown Organizer, outside of Orgrimmar in the Brewfest area during the Brewfest holiday. If you haven&#8217;t completed it already, she&#8217;ll have a quest for participating in the competition.</p>



<p>To join, you&#8217;ll need to wait for the current competition to finish. When you are close you can see the current progress of the current players. As soon as one player reaches 10, the current competition is over and a new one opens up. Quickly right click on an empty seat to join. Be sure to wait for the competition to be over before sitting down, as people will get up from their seats near the end prior to completion to avoid the debuff.  </p>



<p>You will need a player in each seat (for a total of four) to start the competition.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/brewfest-chowdown-competition.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/brewfest-chowdown-competition-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8961" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/brewfest-chowdown-competition-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/brewfest-chowdown-competition-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/brewfest-chowdown-competition-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/brewfest-chowdown-competition-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/brewfest-chowdown-competition.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Abilities</h2>



<p>Once you sit down at a seat, you&#8217;ll have access to three Brewfest Chowdown abilities: </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Eat Sausage</h3>



<p>The first ability eats one of the sausages on your current plate. The number of sausages remaining on your current plate can be seen in front of your character. Eating a sausage increases you Choke meter. When you Choke meter reach maximum, your character will be stunned and not able to use any abilities for a few seconds. A single sausage will add a random amount of Choke meter, usually between 20 and 30 points. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Refreshing Brew</h3>



<p>The second ability will remove some of your Choke meter. It has a maximum of three charges. Because of this charge system, as long as you keep it under three charges it will come off cooldown constantly. The amount of Choke meter removed can be greater than one sausage&#8217;s worth, so don&#8217;t drink unless your Choke meter is above about 50 or so. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">New Plate</h3>



<p>The third ability will create a new plate and increment your count. Even if you have eaten all your current plate, it will not count until you get a new one. You can see how many sausages are left on your current plate by looking at it in front of your character. Once you finish a plate, you wont be able to use the first ability until you get a new one. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-vivid-purple-color has-css-opacity has-vivid-purple-background-color has-background"/>



<script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4537180102637521" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4537180102637521" data-ad-slot="5280630734"></ins>

</script>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Win the Brewfest Chowdown</h2>



<p>The number of sausages you receive per plate is random, so victory will often come down to a bit of RNG. That said however, you can maximize your chances by employing these strategies.</p>



<p>To start, eat two sausages and then take a drink of Refreshing Brew. From there, your goal is to <strong>keep your charges of Refreshing Brew below three</strong>. Keep eating sausages until you current plate is empty, even if this fills your choke meter. </p>



<p>While choking you will be stunned, but will <strong>still be refreshing the cooldown</strong> on Refreshing Brew and decreasing you choke meter by the normal amount. Also, if your choke meter is almost maxed, a sausage will only add up to the maximum 100, <strong>discarding any number over 100</strong>. </p>



<p>Watch your plate or the third ability closely, as this is where you will lose most of your time. Pressing <strong>New Plate as soon as possible</strong> can be the difference between wining and losing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/brewfest-chowdown-trophy.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="838" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/brewfest-chowdown-trophy-838x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8963" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/brewfest-chowdown-trophy-838x1024.jpg 838w, /wp-content/uploads/brewfest-chowdown-trophy-245x300.jpg 245w, /wp-content/uploads/brewfest-chowdown-trophy-768x939.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/brewfest-chowdown-trophy.jpg 864w" sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The Brewfest Chowdown Trophy Toy</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>To simplify by priority: </em></p>



<ol>
<li>Keep Refreshing Brew under three charges while not wasting it on Choke under 50</li>



<li>Get a New Plate when out of sausages</li>



<li>Spam Eat Sausage even if it means choking</li>
</ol>



<p>If it looks like you are not going to win, you can press the leave vehicle button or use the Exit ability to <strong>avoid getting the debuff </strong>that stops you from participating again immediately. You can also kill yourself by falling to remove the debuff; the graveyard is very close.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Learn the best places to quickly and efficiently farm Flax Seeds in Guild Wars 2. This guide includes the best spots from HoT and PoF.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pile_of_Flax_Seeds">Flax Seeds</a> continue to be in great demand due to them being an ingredient in <strong><a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vial_of_Linseed_Oil">Linseed Oil</a>,</strong> an item used in many recipes including Guild Hall upgrades. This guide will show you the best Flax Seed farm spots in Guild Wars 2 Heart of Thorns &amp; Path of Fire.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Flax Seed Farm Spots</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Flax with no fuss: <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jaka_Itzel">Jaka Itzel Waypoint</a> (Verdant Brink)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/flax-farm-verdant-map.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/flax-farm-verdant-map-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9075" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/flax-farm-verdant-map-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/flax-farm-verdant-map-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/flax-farm-verdant-map-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/flax-farm-verdant-map-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/flax-farm-verdant-map.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em><a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jaka_Itzel">Jaka Itzel Waypoint</a> &#8211; Verdant Brink</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This is the best place to farm Flax Seeds. There are enemies that attack the location every now and then, but the NPCs will usually stop them from reaching the farm, freeing you to focus on farming and not fighting. The nodes are also very condensed, making the farm quick. </p>



<p>I suggest parking your alts here and quickly picking up the 7-8 flax nodes every day. Unless you&#8217;re looking to maximize your daily return on Flax, parking your alts here and gathering daily will get you plenty of Flax with minimal time investment.</p>



<p>To reach this Flax farm location, take the Jaka Itzel waypoint in Verdant Brink. Jump over the edge and glide all the way down, slightly north-east of the waypoint.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A little out of the way: <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pride_of_the_Pact">Soulkeeper&#8217;s Airship Waypoint</a> (Bloodstone Fen)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/flax-farm-bloodstone-map.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/flax-farm-bloodstone-map-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9059" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/flax-farm-bloodstone-map-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/flax-farm-bloodstone-map-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/flax-farm-bloodstone-map-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/flax-farm-bloodstone-map-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/flax-farm-bloodstone-map.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em><a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pride_of_the_Pact">Airship Waypoint</a> &#8211; Bloodstone Fen</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This Flax Seed farm is a bit spread out, but still pretty efficient. There are 8 Flax nodes spread out on three floating islands in Bloodstone Fen. There are a few enemies near these nodes, but they won&#8217;t pose much of a threat. Getting to these location will require at least the <strong>Updraft </strong>mastery. <strong>Ley Line Gliding</strong> can make this run even faster, but is not needed. This also takes you to the diving goggles that are a great place to farm <strong>Unbound Magic</strong> daily.</p>



<p>There are three floating islands that contain Flax nodes. Aim for the two on the northern part of the map first. From Soulkeeper&#8217;s Airship Waypoint, use the updrafts (or the Ley Line if you have the mastery) to make your way to the small grass covered floating islands to the north-east of the airship. From there, you can glide down to the top of the large grassy island. Once you harvest the flax nodes there, drop off the northern edge of the island to find the last two nodes.</p>

<p>This spot has a good amount of Flax that is relatively compact. However, there are a few enemies that may interrupt your harvest. The main issue here is that a group event boss can spawn in this area, making it difficult to collect the nodes until it is defeated.</p>



<p>To get to this spot, go to the Heathen&#8217;s Hold Waypoint in Draconis Mons. From there, jump off the western cliff where the three unbound magic nodes are. Fall straight through the three unbound magics and glide to the lower ledge sticking out. From this cliff, enter the cave back to the east.

<p>This group of Flax nodes is protected by some tough enemies. It is also a bit of a pain to get to. You will need the <strong>Updraft</strong> mastery or a <strong>Springer</strong> mount to make it to this spot.</p>



<p>From Order of Whispers Camp Waypoint in Tangled Depths, head toward the open area full of updrafts. Either use those updrafts or your Springer to make it to the south-eastern upper ledge. If using your Springer, climb up the eastern wall toward the Vista. If using updrafts, start at the southern wall. Stay to the left at the fork to make it to the open area with the flax. There are also two chests nearby that can be looted while you are here. </p>



<p>You can also reach this area by using your Springer from the Ogre Camp Waypoint, but the jumps are tough.</p>

<p>This &#8220;spot&#8221; is more of an area. There are multiple flax nodes to find in the Jungle Anomaly of Jahai Bluffs. Most of them are in the upper area of the jungle. To get to them, you will need a <strong>Springer </strong>or the <strong>Bouncing Mushrooms</strong> mastery. You&#8217;ll have to contend with Chakk, so the Chakk mastery is helpful but not necessary. </p>



<p>To get there from the Reclaimed Chantry Waypoint, head south and turn west. Go through the cave to the west. Continue heading west through the Branded area until you make it to the Jungle Anomaly. Once in the anomaly, use your Springer or the bouncing mushrooms to make it up to the higher area. There are flax nodes throughout this area.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Unlocking the Mission</h2>



<p>The Archaeo-Freighter on Europa is one of the 3 Grendel missions and awards you the Grendel Neuroptics blueprint. To unlock the Archaeo-Freighter mission, you will need to purchase a <em>Grendel Neuroptics Locator </em>from the Arbitration Honor vendor in the Arbiters of Hexis room on any relay. This item will cost 25 Vitus Essence (obtainable through Arbitrations), but is not consumed until you complete the mission; you will be able to attempt the mission as many times as you would like until you get the reward for winning.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Build</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Warframe &#8211; Hildryn</h3>



<p>Most Warframes will run out of energy very quickly on these no-mod missions, and even if they do get abilities off, those abilities will not do anything close to what their modded versions do. This build bypasses the energy issue by using Hildryn, who uses her shields as energy. The shield you gain from casting Pillage (#2) will be greater than the cost, allowing you to spam the ability. </p>



<p>While most mods do not effect you during these missions, augment mods still augment abilities. This build uses the augmented version of Hildryn&#8217;s Pillage, <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Blazing_Pillage">Blazing Pillage</a>, to deal damage and restore shields. To benefit from Blazing Pillage, you will need to have Haven (#3) up and be close enough for it to be effecting the enemy you want to burn. This augment will be the main source of damage. Without it, you won&#8217;t kill enemies fast enough to sustain life support.</p>



<p>The build also uses the augmented version of Balefire (#1), <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Balefire_Surge">Balefire Surge</a>, specifically to deal with nullifiers. Nullifiers would normally be immune to the damage from Blazing Pillage, but this augment removes their bubble forever. This augment is not needed, but makes the occasional nullifier much less threatening.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="540" src="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build-1024x540.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9097" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build-1024x540.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build-300x158.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build-768x405.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build.jpg 1059w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Only augment mods work</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Melee Weapon &#8211; Fragor Prime</h3>



<p>Most weapons will feel very underwhelming with no mods. You won&#8217;t be able to equip Blood Rush, so combo counter stacking won&#8217;t do much. The most effective weapons are those with innate elements (especially toxin for bypassing shields), a helpful moveset, or strong base damage. </p>



<p>The weapon I used to deal with Bursas and other tanky enemies was Fragor Prime. Even unmodded, this weapon has a great slam attack that does decent damage and knocks down in a wide area.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Strategy &#8211; Spam Pillage</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Kill Them Quick While Healing Yourself</h3>



<p>Your main source of damage is augmented Pillage (#2). For this augment to deal damage, the enemy will need to be in range of Haven (#3). Pillage should give you more than enough shields back to spam it indefinitely, but you will need to be relatively close to the enemy to actually deal damage. Try to stack enemies up, jump into the middle of them, and spam Pillage.</p>



<p>Like most survival missions, try to kill enemies as fast as possible to generate life support. Unlike normal survival missions, you will likely need to use many of the supplied canisters, so don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re behind for using them.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Notable Enemies</h3>



<p>You will fight Bursas near the end. They can mostly be avoided, but they can be a nuisance. Use you Fragor to take the Bursas down, using Pillage to refill your shields as needed.</p>

<p>Nullifier Crewman will stop your Pillage from dealing damage or giving you shields. Use a full charge shot from Balefire (#1) augmented with Balefire Surge. This will permanently break their nullify bubble, making the just normal crewmen. </p>

<p>The Mine of Karishh on Europa is one of the 3 Grendel missions and awards you the Grendel Systems blueprint.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Build</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Warframe &#8211; Limbo</h3>



<p>This solo strategy relies on avoiding all combat and waiting for the excavators. With Limbo&#8217;s free access to the Rift Plane using dodge, the restrictions on mods and energy do not matter. You also will not need any augments for this strategy to work. Therefore, a no-mod Limbo is all you need.</p>

</script>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Strategy &#8211; Wait in the Rift</h2>



<p>As soon as you zone into the mission, dodge with Limbo to enter the rift. This will make you immune to all damage from enemies. Despite this immunity, enemies will still try to attack you, allowing you to distract them.</p>



<p>When an excavator comes up, run to the waypoint to spawn it while still in the rift. Let 20 seconds pass until the excavator runs out of power, distracting enemies as necessary to ensure it lives.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-rift.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="853" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-rift-853x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9114" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-rift-853x1024.jpg 853w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-rift-250x300.jpg 250w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-rift-768x922.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-rift.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Wait in the Rift</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Let the Excavators Die</h3>



<p>Once the excavator has run out of power, let it die. It will need to be gone for another excavator to spawn in that location. There is no limit on the number of excavators that will spawn, so don&#8217;t worry about running out. If no new excavators are spawning, encourage the enemies to destroy the existing ones.</p>



<p>Each excavator will give you 20 Cryotic with this strategy. This means that you will need 40 excavators to reach the 800 Cryotic you need. This will take a while, but is very safe and mostly AFK.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-excavator.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1018" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-excavator-1018x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9110" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-excavator-1018x1024.jpg 1018w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-excavator-298x300.jpg 298w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-excavator-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-excavator-768x772.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-systems-excavator.jpg 1074w" sizes="(max-width: 1018px) 100vw, 1018px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>20 Cryotic per Excavator, 40 Excavators</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Notable Enemies</h3>



<p>Nullifier bubbles can pull you out of the rift. They can be mostly avoided, but sometimes they will be in tight corridors, making them unavoidable. If you have to pass through a nullifier bubble, bullet jump through, and dodge again as soon as you get past it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Build</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Warframe &#8211; Hildryn</h3>



<p>Most Warframes will run out of energy very quickly on these no-mod missions, and even if they do get abilities off, those abilities will not do anything close to what their modded versions do. This build bypasses the energy issue by using Hildryn, who uses her shields as energy. The shield you gain from casting Pillage (#2) will be greater than the cost, allowing you to spam the ability. </p>



<p>While most mods do not effect you during these missions, augment mods still augment abilities. This build uses the augmented version of Hildryn&#8217;s Pillage, <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Blazing_Pillage">Blazing Pillage</a>, to deal damage and restore shields. To benefit from Blazing Pillage, you will need to have Haven (#3) up and be close enough for it to be effecting the enemy you want to burn. This augment will be the main source of damage. Without it, the enemies will destroy the defense target faster than you can kill them.</p>



<p>The build also uses the augmented version of Balefire (#1), <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Balefire_Surge">Balefire Surge</a>, specifically to deal with nullifiers. Nullifiers would normally be immune to the damage from Blazing Pillage, but this augment removes their bubble forever. This augment is not needed, but makes the occasional nullifier much less threatening.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="540" src="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build-1024x540.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9097" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build-1024x540.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build-300x158.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build-768x405.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/grendel-chassis-build.jpg 1059w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Only augment mods work</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Melee Weapon &#8211; Fragor Prime</h3>



<p>Most weapons will feel very underwhelming with no mods. You won&#8217;t be able to equip Blood Rush, so combo counter stacking won&#8217;t do much. The most effective weapons are those with innate elements (especially toxin for bypassing shields), a helpful moveset, or strong base damage. </p>



<p>The weapon I used for the Bursas in wave #15 and other tanky enemies was Fragor Prime. Even unmodded, this weapon has a great slam attack that does decent damage and knocks down in a wide area.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Strategy &#8211; Spam Pillage</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Kill Them Before They Kill It</h3>



<p>Your main source of damage is augmented Pillage (#2). For this augment to deal damage, the enemy will need to be in range of Haven (#3). Pillage should give you more than enough shields back to spam it indefinitely, but you will need to be relatively close to the enemy to actually deal damage. </p>



<p>That being said, you will also want to remain close to the defense target. This will not only encourage enemies to attack into your limitless shields instead of the target, but also allow Haven to restore the shields of the target. Wait for your enemies to be about a bullet jump away. Get in, drop your burn from Pillage, and then get back to the defense target. The fire from Pillage will tick over time, killing most enemies with one or two casts.</p>



<p>Blazing Pillage will CC humanoid Corpus through heat procs, but if there are mechanical enemies that you need to CC, this is the time to use the Fragor. The slam attack will knock down targets and stop them from hitting the defense target.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Give the Defense Target a Break</h3>



<p>You won&#8217;t be able to stop all of the enemies from dealing damage to the defense target. Every wave, try to leave the last enemy alive and give the defense target a chance to regain its health and shields. Once you are down to one enemy, use the terrain to line of sight it so that it can&#8217;t hit you. If it can&#8217;t hit you for too long, it will go for the defense target instead, so every five seconds or so, jump or otherwise move into its line of sight to keep its attention.</p>



<p>Some waves you&#8217;ll accidentally kill every enemy and go right on to the next wave, but as long as you are healing the defense target back to full every few waves, you should never fail from it being destroyed. </p>

<p>15 waves will take a long time. Be ready for this mission to take a while and require your attention pretty much the entire fight. You only have to do this mission once (twice if you plan to give a Grendel to the <a href="https://marvweb.com/helminth-chrysalis-new-abilities-for-every-warframe/">Helminth Chrysalis</a>), so take it slow, especially once you get near the end. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Notable Enemies</h3>



<p>You will fight two Bursas in the last wave (#15). Generally the Bursas will focus on you, but try to go into the last wave with the defense target at full health to be safe. Take out the rest of the enemies first, then use you Fragor to take the Bursas down, using Pillage to refill your shields as needed.</p>

<p>Nullifier Crewman will stop your Pillage from dealing damage or giving you shields. Use a full charge shot from Balefire (#1) augmented with Balefire Surge. This will permanently break their nullify bubble, making the just normal crewmen. </p>

<p>The first expansion for Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield, the Isle of Armor, adds many conveniences. Most of these additions help in maxing out Pokemon and getting them ready for competition. However, Isle of Armor also adds a whole new way to farm Pokedollars that is more simple than any other farm. This guide will show you the easiest money farm in the game.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Unlocking the Cram-o-matic</h3>



<p>The Cram-o-Matic is a new vendor in the Isle of Armor. It is located inside the Master Dojo. You unlock it by giving 500 Watts to Hyde, who is usually <em>hiding</em> at his desk. This machine takes four of your items and gives you a new item in return. There are recipes that guarentee specific items or get you an item from a list of items. For instance, giving it four of the same Apricorn will give you back a Pokeball from the drop table of that color. If you want to learn the recipes yourself without looking them up, Hyde will teach you one for every 100 Watts you give him.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Farming Money Using the Cram-o-matic</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/easiest-money-farm-recipe.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="556" height="268" src="/wp-content/uploads/easiest-money-farm-recipe.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9032" style="width:381px;height:184px" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/easiest-money-farm-recipe.jpg 556w, /wp-content/uploads/easiest-money-farm-recipe-300x145.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" /></a></figure>



<p>To farm money by doing nothing but spamming A, you&#8217;ll need to craft <strong>TR88 Heat Crash</strong>. The recipe is <strong>four Cheri Berries</strong>. Cheri Berries can be purchased for 80 Pokedollars each from the berry vendor just outside the Master Dojo. The TR sells for 3,000 Pokedollars, giving you a profit of 2,680 Pokedollars. After the initial craft, your cursor will remain on Cheri Berry. This allows you to just press A to repeat the process. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Competitive Pokemon (PvP)</h4>



<p>The Master Dojo has an <a href="/isle-of-armor-dojo-upgrades/">upgrade system</a> that will allow you purchase vitamins for half the price they used to be. This means you can now raise the EVs of competitive Pokemon for half the price it used to cost, once you <a href="/farm-watts-in-isle-of-armor/">farm the Watts required</a> to unlock this discount.</p>

<p>The new Restricted Sparring system is a great new way to farm BP. You will need to have competitive ready Pokemon though to really make it efficient. Luckily, with all the BP you&#8217;ll be earning, that won&#8217;t be too difficult. You will still need to buy vitamins to max their EVs though.</p>

<p>Max Raid Battles are a staple of Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield. These battles pit you and three other Players/NPCs against a permanently Dynamaxed Pokemon. A quick and efficient Max Raid Battle farm strategy is a must for endgame Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Access Max Raid Battles</h2>



<p>The first way to access Max Raid Battles is to find the glowing dens around the Wild Area. These glowing dens spawn throughout the day, giving you a number of free fights. Every glowing den contains a Max Raid Battle that you can choose to invite others to or do offline with NPCs. </p>



<p>The second method to spawn a Max Raid battle is to use a Wishing Piece on a den that is NOT currently glowing. This will spawn a Max Raid Battle at that den, which can then be completed like a normal battle. Wishing pieces can be earned in a number of ways, but purchasing them with Watts is the most consistent.</p>



<p>The final method of accessing Max Raid Battles is to join someone else&#8217;s using the Y-Comm. This will allow you to search for other people who are looking for people to help them with their Max Raid Battles. With a Nintendo Switch Online membership, you can search for other players using the internet. Without this connection, you will have to be physically close to the Switch of the person you want to play with over Local Communications. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Rewards from Max Raid Battles</h2>



<p>Max Raid Battles offer a number of important rewards, making them a worthwhile farm:</p>



<ul>
<li>Pokemon caught in Max Raid Battles are guaranteed to have a number of max IVs
<ul>
<li>The number of max IVs depends on the number of stars for the fight</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Pokemon in Max Raid Battles have a high chance of being shiny compared to normal encounters</li>



<li>Completing the fight will reward a number of items regardless of if you capture it or not, including:
<ul>
<li>Dynamax Candies</li>



<li>Rare and Exp. Candies</li>



<li>One-time use Technical Records (TRs)</li>



<li>Berries</li>



<li>Vendor trash that can be sold for Pokedollars</li>



<li>Armorite Ore (Isle of Armor battles only)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Farm Max Raid Battles</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Host Your Own</h3>



<p>The simplest way to complete as many Max Raid Battles as possible is to create them yourself. If you create them yourself, you won&#8217;t have to deal with the issues with Y-Comm even if you choose to have other join you using it. Every day you will get a few free battles. Once these are completed, you can continue spawning more using wishing pieces. To sustain this method, you will have to spend Watts. </p>



<p>To help with this, you can spend any Armorite you are getting from Isle of Armor battles at <a href="/farm-watts-in-isle-of-armor/">Digging Pa</a>. Assuming the worst case scenario of only getting 1 Armorite per raid battle, you will need to get at least 21,000 Watts on average from Digging Pa. Considering you will sometimes get 2 or 3 Armorite per wishing piece, this is a sustainable way to farm Armorite Ore, Watts, and all of the other rewards from Max Raid Battles.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Join Others</h3>



<p><em>Your Switch needs to be connected to the internet using Nintendo Switch Online to use this method.</em></p>



<p>The most efficient way to farm Max Raid battles is to join other players, saving your Watts for your <a href="/isle-of-armor-dojo-upgrades/">3 Million Watt Dojo Upgrades</a>. You can do this from anywhere using the Y-Comm to search for &#8220;Seeking&#8221; cards. If you ever tried to just join a card that comes up, you&#8217;ve likely been met with a message saying that it is full or no longer available. The reason for this is that the Y-Comm does not update regularly, so by the time you apply, other players have already filled it.</p>

<p>To get around this issue, you will have to convince Y-Comm to send you updates more often. To do this, start a &#8220;Surprise Trade.&#8221; You won&#8217;t actually be trading this Pokemon, but pick one you wouldn&#8217;t mind trading, just in case. Once you have started searching for a Surprise Trade partner, open the Y-Comm again and you will see that the cards are refreshing at a much faster pace. When you see a raid battle you want, spam A on it. This will cancel your current Surprise Trade and join the Max Raid battle. You will normally join around the 2:47 mark if you get in quick. </p>



<p>Despite joining so quickly, many other people know this strategy, so you are still likely to run into full battles, especially for the rare fights. If you run into a full room or an error, queue up another Surprise Trade and try again. Also, be sure to check the icons shown on the cards. A lock indicates that a password is required (likely someone hosting for a friend) and the Isle of Armor symbol indicates an Isle of Armor battle. Only Isle of Armor battles will reward Armorite Ore.</p>
