					<description><![CDATA[G-Max Coalossal can outspeed and OHKO almost anything with this Steam Engine Weakness Policy doubles team for Pokemon Sword &#038; Shield. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This doubles strategy makes use of <a href="https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/coalossal/">Coalossal&#8217;s</a> ability <a href="https://www.serebii.net/abilitydex/steamengine.shtml">Steam Engine</a> ability to give it a huge speed boost while also doubling its Special Attack through <a href="https://www.serebii.net/itemdex/weaknesspolicy.shtml">Weakness Policy</a>, allowing Coalossal to OHKO most Pokemon with its great type coverage. It also sets up G-Max Volcalith to whittle down defensive opponents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">G-Max Coalossal&#8217;s Build</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coalossal-swsh-doubles-stats.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coalossal-swsh-doubles-stats.jpg" alt="Coalossal, Steam Engine, Spd+, Atk-, 252 Spd, 252 SpA" class="wp-image-1134"/></a></figure></div>



<p>Coalossal makes up for its terrible speed with great special attack and good bulk. With a base stat of 110 HP, it is a great target to Dynamax since Dynamaxing doubles the Pokemon&#8217;s health. However, it has a 4x weakness to Water, meaning that hard hitting Water moves can still OHKO it.  </p>



<p>Coalossal&#8217;s nature and EV distribution is left a bit up to choice. The most important stats for Coalossal are Special Attack, Speed, and HP. Focusing on Special Attack and Speed give Coalossal the best chance of being able to OHKO a Pokemon before it gets its turn. However, in situations where you won&#8217;t be able to OHKO or the opponent has priority moves, the extra bulk from HP will significantly increase how long Coalossal lives. HP is also a great choice if you expect that your opponent will be able to shut down your Water Enabler (see <a href="#counters">Counters</a>). </p>



<p>You can also min/max a bit with the SpA and Spe values to just perfectly outspeed or OHKO the Pokemon you expect to be up against, allowing you to put more EVs into HP. Since it is tough to account for every possible scenario, especially with the prevalence of speed increases like Max Airstream, I suggest just maxing EVs in SpA and Spe, even if it ends up being a bit overkill.</p>



<p>The moves are chosen to maximize G-Max damage; Coalossal will not be very effective when not G-Maxed, but if you get three G-Max moves off with this build, you are likely doing well.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Water Enabler&#8217;s Build</h2>



<p>To trigger Coalossal&#8217;s Steam Engine and Weakness policy at the same time, you will want to hit it with a water move. There are two good options for water moves to use on your Coalossal &#8211; Aqua Jet and Surf.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://serebii.net/attackdex-swsh/aquajet.shtml">Aqua Jet</a></h3>



<p>The best option to guarantee you outspeed your opponent is Aqua Jet, a <strong>+1 priority</strong> water move. Aqua Jet allows your Water Enabler to bypass speed concerns, opening up a more diverse set of builds, including bulky supports. </p>



<p>Where Aqua Jet will have issues when compared to Surf is against Follow Me and Rage Powder. These moves will redirect your Aqua Jet into the other Pokemon instead of Coalossal. See <a href="#counters">Counters </a>for more on this.</p>



<p>A couple good options to consider for an Aqua Jet Water Enabler:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/azumarill/">Azumarill </a>&#8211; 50 Atk, 100 HP, bulky, Light Screen, Grass absorb</li><li><a href="https://serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/clawitzer/">Clawitzer </a>&#8211; 73 Atk, 120 SpA, solid Special Attacker</li></ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-sm/surf.shtml">Surf</a></h3>



<p>Another option instead of Aqua Jet is to bring Surf on a fast Pokemon. Similar to Aqua Jet, you will want this move to hit for very little. The benefit of Surf over Aqua Jet is Surf <strong>hits the entire field</strong>. This ignores one of the major counters to an Aqua Jet setup, Follow Me and Rage Powder. The AoE of Surf also hits opponents, removing their Focus Sashes before Coalossal gets its first hit.</p>



<p>The issue with Surf is that your snabler is more vulnerable to priority moves and fast Pokemon. Whimsicott&#8217;s Trickster priority Tailwind can make many Pokemon faster than your Water Enabler, potentially OHKOing it before it gets Surf off. See <a href="#counters">Counters </a>for more on this.</p>



<p>Some Pokemon to consider as Surf Water Enablers:</p>



<ul id="block-913754ec-e6f8-4707-822f-69a39aecb32b"><li><a href="https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/weavile/">Weavile </a>&#8211; 125 Speed, 45 Special Attack, non-STAB Water</li><li><a href="https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/dragapult/">Dragapult </a>&#8211; 142 Speed, 100 Special Attack, non-STAB Water</li><li><a href="https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/barraskewda/">Barraskewda</a> &#8211; 136 Speed, 60 Special Attack</li></ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Minimize Damage</h3>



<p>Whether you pick Aqua Jet, Surf, or any other water move, you will want it to hit for as little as possible to avoid dealing unnecessary damage to your Coalossal. This means that you should have a 0 IV (&#8220;No Good&#8221;) in the associated damage stat (Attack for Aqua Jet and Special Attack for Surf). This will keep your Coalossal as healthy as possible and potentially allow it to take a few hits.</p>



<script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4537180102637521" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-vivid-purple-background-color has-vivid-purple-color"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Strategy: Attack Your Coalossal With Water</h2>



<p>In an ideal opening turn (with no counters), G-Max your Coalossal and aim to OHKO any threats to Coalossal, like water types. If you don&#8217;t need to pick a specific move to guarantee a kill, try to set up G-Max Volcalith as soon as possible. Volcalith&#8217;s 1/6 health per turn to both opponents adds up quickly and counters any Focus Sash they may have.</p>



<p>With your Water Enabler. hit Coalossal with the water ability to trigger Steam Engine and Weakness Policy. Steam Engine will make Coalossal faster than most Pokemon, especially on turn one before they&#8217;ve had much of a chance to setup. Weakness Policy will give a +2 to Coalossal&#8217;s Special Attack, effectively doubling the amount of damage it deals.  </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-vivid-purple-background-color has-vivid-purple-color"/>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="counters">G-Max Coalossal Counters</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Focus Sash Water Attacker</h3>



<p>A Focus Sashed Pokemon with a powerful water type move can OHKO Coalossal. Remember that Coalossal takes 4x damage from water.  Coalossal can outspeed almost any Pokemon once Steam Engine is active and G-Max Volcalith will finish off any sashed Pokemon at the end of the turn. However, you won&#8217;t be able to stop a Pokemon with a Focus Sash from hitting Coalossal at least once. </p>



<p>To account for this, you can bring Fake Out on your Water Enabler and try to take out the sashed Pokemon without Weakness Policy. You might consider switching in a Pokemon that resists or absorbs water and bring Coalossal back once the threat is gone. The issue with Focus Sash is that you won&#8217;t know for sure if a Pokemon has one. Pokemon that are likely to have a Focus Sash are hard hitting but low health &#8216;glass cannons&#8217; like Barraskewda.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fake Out</h3>



<p>Fake Out can stop you Water Enabler from activating Coalossal. This will not only stop Weakness Policy on Coalossal, but also block the activation of Steam Engine. Your opponent&#8217;s other Pokemon can potentially take Coalossal down before it gets to do anything. </p>



<p>The best way to deal with a Fake Out starter is to replace one of Coalossal&#8217;s moves with Protect. Use Protect on your first turn and do the combo on the second. Your opponent may go for you Water Enabler though, so a Protect, Fake Out, or a Focus Sash can help get them to the next turn. The issue here is that you&#8217;ll be losing one of your coverage moves on Coalossal, though having Max Guard against other threats is always nice. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-vivid-purple-background-color has-vivid-purple-color"/>



<script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4537180102637521" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4537180102637521" data-ad-slot="5280630734"></ins>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Water Enabler Counters</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Redirect &#8211; Aqua Jet Counter</h4>



<p>Aqua Jet is a targeted ability. If your opponent uses Follow Me or any other redirect move, Aqua Jet will attack the new target instead of Coalossal. Redirect moves have a higher priority than Aqua Jet, so you won&#8217;t be able to go before it. If you don&#8217;t deal with a redirector, they will likely redirect the next turn as well.</p>



<p>This is very hard to deal with on an Aqua Jet setup. Barraskewda can learn Aqua Jet and has the ability Propeller Tail, which ignores redirects. However, Barraskewda hits very hard with Aqua Jet, even with a 0 IV, so be careful hitting your Coalossal with it. For other Pokemon, the best way to get around it is to take out the redirector on the first turn and hope that your opponents other Pokemon doesn&#8217;t hit too hard.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Fast Pokemon &#8211; Surf Counter</h4>



<p>Surf is not a priority move. Your opponent can go before you and potentially OHKO your Water Enabler or Coalossal before you get a chance to activate Steam Engine. </p>



<p>A Focus Sash on your Water Enabler can keep them alive through at least one hit. Picking a high speed Surf Pokemon is important to not run into this counter too often.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This Thief tagging build focuses on getting credit for as many enemies as possible in large group content like Meta Events and PvE Zergs. This build focuses on dishing out quick and consistent AoE damage that hits hard enough to get credit for the enemy&#8217;s death. This will maximize the amount of loot you get while running with large groups. </p>



<p>This is my personal favorite of all of my tagging builds. I feel that Thief outperforms every other class when it comes to maximizing kill credit. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-vivid-purple-background-color has-vivid-purple-color"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Build</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thief-tagging-build.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thief-tagging-build.jpg" alt="The skills and traits for a thief tag build" class="wp-image-1042"/></a><figcaption><em>Thief Tagging Build</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Build Code: <em>[&amp;DQUsFTY9BxqUEgwBNAFbAVcBVgFYADMBnwEoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=]</em></strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Abilities</h3>



<p>This build relies on the spammable AoE of <strong>Trick Shot</strong>, the #1 ability on Shortbow. <strong>Infiltrator&#8217;s Arrow</strong> (Shortbow #5) can be used to catch up with groups or get out in front to secure tags. <strong>Cluster Bomb</strong> (Shortbow #2) for power builds or <strong>Choking Gas</strong> (Shortbow #4) for condition builds can be used to spread a bit of damage in a specific area, but often is not needed. Remember though that Cluster Bomb and Choking Gas will use up initiative that could otherwise be used on Infiltrator&#8217;s Arrows.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thief-tagging-abilities.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thief-tagging-abilities.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1043"/></a><figcaption><em>Weapons and Skills</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>For the heal skill, <strong>Channeled Vigor</strong> can be used as a utility skill to refill your endurance. Signet of Malice is a good choice for some mindless sustain if you don&#8217;t have Daredevil.</p>



<p>For Utility skills, I suggest <strong>Blinding Powder</strong> for those instances where you overextend or outrun the main group. <strong>Signet of Agility</strong> is great as another way to refill your endurance. However, if you are don&#8217;t have the permanent swiftness that Daredevil gives, consider bringing Signet of Shadows to increase your movement speed out of Swiftness. Finally, <strong>Shadowstep</strong> is a great gap closer, similar to Infiltrator&#8217;s Arrow with a longer reach. It will help keep you at the front of the group.</p>



<p>For the Elite Skill, <strong>Dagger Storm</strong> is a great skill to drop in the middle of a large group of enemies. Be sure to move around while channeling it to try to hit every enemy you can. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Traits</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thief-tagging-daredevil.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thief-tagging-daredevil.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1044"/></a><figcaption><em>Daredevil: 2 2 3</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Daredevil is a great addition to this build, as it supplies you with permanent Swiftness and augments your dodges to deal AoE damage. From the Daredevil tree, <strong>Escapist&#8217;s Fortitude</strong> allows you to clear troublesome conditions. <strong>Havoc Specialist</strong> will almost always be up with how often you will be dodge rolling. The last trait choice for Daredevil is up to you.<strong> Impaling Lotus</strong> will give you access to a lot of spammable point-blank AoE, but if you are having trouble keeping up with the group, Dash has a longer reach and increased Swiftness bonus.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-vivid-purple-background-color has-vivid-purple-color"/>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thief-tagging-trickery.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thief-tagging-trickery.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1045"/></a><figcaption><em>Trickery: 1 1 1</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Trickery further augments your dodge rolls to make them even more effective for tagging enemies while also supplying you with more initiative for Infiltrator&#8217;s Arrows. <strong>Uncatchable</strong> will leave caltrops, a 3 second duration AoE, at the location you dodge, even if you are using Dash. The tier 2 choice for Trickery is not all that impactful, but picking up <strong>Bountiful Theft</strong> will give boons to nearby allies, further increasing your chances getting loot from tagged enemies. Finally, <strong>Quick Pockets</strong> will help keep your initiative high for Infiltrator&#8217;s Arrows.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thief-tagging-acrobatics.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thief-tagging-acrobatics.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1046"/></a><figcaption><em>Acrobatics: 1 3 3</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Acrobatics makes spamming dodge rolls easier with the minor trait Feline Grace. You also gain Swiftness every time you dodge and since this build can dodge so often, you can keep Swiftness up permanently. <strong>Instant Reflexes</strong> can save you from big hits since you will be quite squishy, giving you enough time to Blinding Powder or retreat. <strong>Hard to Catch</strong> is a great way to shrug off the occasional CC. Finally,<strong> Don&#8217;t Stop</strong> will keep you moving quick as long as you maintain Swiftness. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stats</h3>



<p>You stat choice is not too important for this build, but I do suggest a full <strong>Berserker&#8217;s</strong> set if you can. This will nearly guarantee that a single hit from Trick Shot will give you kill credit on normal enemies. Survivability is not much of an issue with this build, as you will be at range with access to many dodge rolls.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Playstyle</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Moving Group</h3>



<p>If the group is moving, <strong>stay near the front</strong> by maintaining Swiftness through dodge rolling and closing gaps with Infiltrator&#8217;s Arrow and Shadowstep. This will allow you to tag enemies early and move on to others. One Trick Shot hit will often be enough to get credit for the kill, especially with a Berserker&#8217;s set, allowing you to move to the next group. Try to target a different enemy with each shot, preferably one away from the last group of enemies you hit. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Camping Spawns</h3>



<p>When trying to tag enemies that your group is camping the spawn location of, drop a <strong>Choking Gas</strong> or dodge roll to <strong>drop caltrops</strong> on the spot enemies will spawn. Use Steal to buff nearby allies with Bountiful Theft, as often Choking Gas will not be enough damage to secure kill credit. Other than that, you can often get at least one Trick Shot off before groups die as long as you react quickly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Large Enemy Groups</h3>



<p>For large groups of many enemies, drop a few Chocking Gases or Cluster Bombs while you move into the enemy group. Once there, dodge roll to <strong>drop caltrops</strong> in the group and avoid damage. After you&#8217;ve spent your endurance, go into <strong>Dagger Storm</strong> to tag enemies near you. Use <strong>Shadowstep </strong>about halfway through the Dagger Storm channel to move to another concentrated group of enemies. Use your endurance refill abilities and keep using your dodge roll to tag nearby enemies. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">World vs. World</h3>



<p>This build does not perform as well in a PvP environment as it does in a PvE environment. This build is very squishy and can be quickly taken down by enemy players, even while sticking with a friendly team. It&#8217;s range is low, forcing you to move into dangerous ranges to even hit an enemy. However, if you are playing WvW more like a PvE game, moving uncontested between Forts and Keeps, this build works great at securing credit. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hildryn can regain the shield spent on Defy during its invulnerability, allowing her to spam Defy forever and making her nearly invincible.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There is a reason I ranked <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Defy">Defy </a>so high in my <a href="https://marvweb.com/helminth-abilities-which-are-best/">subsume ability tier list</a>. This Hildryn build uses Wukong&#8217;s Helminth ability, Defy, to become immune to damage and reflect damage back to enemies. Because Hildryn uses shields to cast Defy, and she regains those shields during the invulnerability duration, <strong>Hildryn can spam Defy forever.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>



<ul><li>Give Hildryn the ability Defy</li><li>Mod for high shield regen and ability strength/range/duration</li><li>Spam Defy to be invulnerable and reflect damage </li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="unlocking-defy-on-hildryn">Unlocking Defy on Hildryn</h2>



<p>To be able to use Defy on Hildryn, you will need to <a href="https://marvweb.com/how-to-unlock-the-helminth-heart-of-deimos/">unlock your Helminth</a>. Once you have it unlocked, you&#8217;ll need to subsume a non-prime Wukong to unlock its ability. Once this is done, you can replace one of Hildryn&#8217;s abilities with Defy using the Helminth. </p>



<p>I replaced <strong>Aegis Storm</strong> because I never saw myself floating around CCing when I could be spamming Defy. <strong>Haven </strong>would have been my other choice as I don&#8217;t use it often either, but it can be decent in a group setting for supporting your allies.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hildryn-defy-subsume.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hildryn-defy-subsume-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-958"/></a><figcaption><em>Use the Helminth to replace Aegis Storm or Haven with Defy</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-vivid-purple-background-color has-vivid-purple-color"/>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-build">The build</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="warframe">Warframe</h3>



<p>Hildryn uses shields to cast abilities. This includes abilities added by the Helminth. Defy costs Hildryn 500 shields unmodded to cast. However, because it makes her invulnerable and take no damage from attacks, <strong>shield recharge</strong> starts during the invulnerability of Defy.</p>



<p>All four ability enhancements are useful, so this build doesn&#8217;t use too many corrupted mods. That said, ability efficiency is the least helpful. With a good amount of shields and shield recharge, you will regain the shields spent on Defy during the invulnerability duration. </p>



<p>Since there is a very small window in between Defys that you are vulnerable, <strong>Arcane Barrier</strong> can help you get back your shields and be able to cast Defy again. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hildryn-defy-warframe.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hildryn-defy-warframe-1024x352.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-953"/></a><figcaption><em>Shield maximum, shield regen, and everything but ability efficiency</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>For the last mod slot, if you are doing very high level content, you can bring<strong> <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Adaptation">Adaptation</a></strong><a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Adaptation"> </a>to cover the small amount of time you are vulnerable. Remember though you wont gain Adaptation stacks while invulnerable from Defy.</p>



<p>If you are running lower level content or there are large gaps between enemies, <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Rush"><strong>Rush</strong> </a>is a good option to make you a bit faster.</p>



<p><strong>Arcane Aegis</strong> is a decent choice for the second Arcane since it helps get your shields back. You can bring weapon damage boost Arcanes if you are planning to use you weapons a bit and not just spam Defy the whole mission. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="companion">Companion</h3>



<p>In high level content, you companion will very likely die. However, there are some very helpful things that come from companions like item vacuum, loot and enemy radar, and most importantly for this build, <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian">Guardian</a>. This make the <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Djinn"><strong>Djinn </strong></a>a great option as it can recover from death forever and continue giving you all these benefits. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="weapons">Weapons</h3>



<p>Weapons are up to you. This build is targeted at high level content where almost all of your damage will be from reflected Defy damage. For long endless missions, you can bring an AoE Radiation proc weapon like Ignis Wraith to clear Eximus buffs from groups. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-vivid-purple-background-color has-vivid-purple-color"/>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="usage">Usage</h2>



<p>The execution of this build really is as easy as <strong>spamming Defy</strong>. During the invulnerability, you will regenerate the amount of shield you spent. Once it runs out, cast it again. Try to group enemies up and move near them to maximize the reflected damage. </p>



<p>Even spamming though, there is a brief window where you will be vulnerable. If the enemies are able to reduce your shield to the point where you cannot cast Defy during that very short window, run away and recharge shields. Hopefully though your companion and Arcane Barrier cover these rare instances.</p>



<p>This build excels at <strong>large groups or hard hitting enemies</strong>. The more damage you take during your Defy, the more damage you reflect back. This build also works better solo, as enemies will be more likely to shoot you instead of your allies.</p>



<p>This is not a speed running build. When channeling Defy, you will not be able to jump or move quickly. This build is better in situations where you are staying in one general area like Survival.</p>

<p>With this specialized Octavia build, you can stay in a Survival mission for as long as you want. With infinite invisibility and damage that scales off of your enemies, multi-hour Survivals are easy. This build even works with <a href="https://marvweb.com/the-steel-path/">Steel Path</a>, making it a great Steel Essence farm in addition to the other resources you&#8217;ll be getting.</p>



<p>Steel Essence has a low chance to drop from Eximus enemies in Steel Path missions. Eximus enemies have an increased chance to spawn as the survival mission progresses, capping at one hour.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Build: Octavia Mallet &amp; Stealth</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Warframe</h3>



<p>This build uses Octavia&#8217;s Mallet (#1) for damage and Metronome (#3) for stealth. Ability duration makes the strategy less energy reliant and reduces the amount of times you will need to recast abilities. Ability range is important for killing enemies as quickly as possible. Ability strength is helpful, but due to the nature of Mallet scaling off of damage taken, it is not too important.</p>



<p>Low defenses will not be a problem as Octavia can remain in stealth for the entire mission. The Arcane energize will help with energy management, but is not required. If you don&#8217;t have it, bring some Energy Restores just in case you get unlucky with energy drops.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/steel-essence-farm-octavia.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/steel-essence-farm-octavia-1024x356.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-699"/></a><figcaption>Duration &gt; Range &gt; Strength &gt; Efficiency</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Weapon</h3>



<p>Weapon damage will quickly become irrelevant as the enemies scale higher. Therefore, the weapon for this strategy focuses on supporting the Mallet damage. Radiation status procs make the affected enemies part of their own team. This is very helpful in removing proximity based buffs, like Eximus or Ancients, from groups of enemies.</p>



<p>The most important aspect of the weapon is to spread radiation procs quickly. Ignis Wraith&#8217;s inherent punch through, wide AoE, fast attack rate, and high status chance make it perfect for this task. You can add damage if you want, but almost all of your damage will come from Mallet.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Steel Essence Farm: Which Survival Mission?</h2>



<p>I&#8217;ve tried a few different survival missions with this strategy. Personally, I found <strong>Mot in the Void</strong> to be the best. Corrupted enemies have high damage, deal that damage from medium range, and Heavy Gunners survive long enough to really boost up the Mallet damage. The Void tileset also has multiple rooms that are open and great for Mallet.</p>



<p>Dark Sector Infested missions like <strong>Gabii on Cerus</strong> can be good too, especially with the increase resource drop rate. However, Infested don&#8217;t work as well against Mallet. Most of them are melee enemies and won&#8217;t contribute to the scaling damage. Also, they will clog up in the tight corridors on the tileset, reducing the number of kills per second you will get.</p>



<p>Corpus don&#8217;t deal enough damage to quickly scale Mallet to counteract their shields, especially with Steel Path buffs. Also, most Corpus tilesets are not great for Mallet.</p>



<p>Grineer have a similar issue to Corpus. The amount of health and armor they have on Steel Path is just too much compared to their damage output.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Strategy: Watch the Mallet &#8211; Collect the Loot</h2>



<p>Start the mission by casting Metronome (#3) and crouching until you stealth. Maintain this stealth for the entire mission.</p>



<p>Find an open tile to maximize the effectiveness of Mallet (#1). Cast Mallet in a central location that can be seen throughout the room. Buff Mallet with Amp (#4) to increase its range. </p>



<p>With you in stealth, the Mallet will be the only viable target, making all enemies on the map run to attack it. The best rooms will force the enemies to come into the room a bit before attacking. This will stop them from crowding and blocking the doors. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/steel-essence-farm-mallet.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/steel-essence-farm-mallet-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-695"/></a><figcaption>Open area, not gathering at doors</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Loot Carefully</h3>



<p>With Mallet, Amp, and stealth up, you&#8217;re free to collect loot. Be careful of Nullifier Crewman and other proximity effects while looting. Also, do not get too close to the Mallet to avoid splash damage.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/steel-essence-farm-drops.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/steel-essence-farm-drops-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-701"/></a><figcaption>With everything up, it&#8217;s time to loot</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Enemy Immunity: Radiation Procs</h3>



<p>Enemy groups will include more Eximus as time progresses, up to a maximum chance at one hour. Sometimes these groups will have a composition of Eximus and Ancients that makes them immune to damage. If you see a bunch of zeroes popping up, it&#8217;s time to break up their friendship. </p>



<p>Radiation procs from Ignis will isolate enemies, meaning they will no longer receive buffs from others. Once on their own, they will die to Mallet like normal.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Steel Essence Farm Team</h2>



<p>If you are bringing friends, this farm can be even better. The team can use Octavia&#8217;s Metronome for stealth too, but you&#8217;ll have to be relatively coordinated on when to loot to keep everyone stealthed. </p>



<p>A <strong>Speedva</strong> (negative power strength Nova) can greatly increase the rate at which enemies die. <strong>Nekros</strong> can reroll bodies for even more loot. <strong>Khora&#8217;s</strong> Pilfering Strangledome and <strong>Hydroid&#8217;s</strong> Pilfering Swarm can also increase the amount of loot dropped, but might limit the effectiveness of Mallet.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Unlocking the Mission</h2>



<p>The Archaeo-Freighter on Europa is one of the 3 Grendel missions and awards you the Grendel Neuroptics blueprint. To unlock the Archaeo-Freighter mission, you will need to purchase a <em>Grendel Neuroptics Locator </em>from the Arbitration Honor vendor in the Arbiters of Hexis room on any relay. This item will cost 25 Vitus Essence (obtainable through Arbitrations), but is not consumed until you complete the mission; you will be able to attempt the mission as many times as you would like until you get the reward for winning.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Build</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Warframe &#8211; Hildryn</h3>



<p>Most Warframes will run out of energy very quickly on these no-mod missions, and even if they do get abilities off, those abilities will not do anything close to what their modded versions do. This build bypasses the energy issue by using Hildryn, who uses her shields as energy. The shield you gain from casting Pillage (#2) will be greater than the cost, allowing you to spam the ability. </p>



<p>While most mods do not effect you during these missions, augment mods still augment abilities. This build uses the augmented version of Hildryn&#8217;s Pillage, <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Blazing_Pillage">Blazing Pillage</a>, to deal damage and restore shields. To benefit from Blazing Pillage, you will need to have Haven (#3) up and be close enough for it to be effecting the enemy you want to burn. This augment will be the main source of damage. Without it, you won&#8217;t kill enemies fast enough to sustain life support.</p>



<p>The build also uses the augmented version of Balefire (#1), <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Balefire_Surge">Balefire Surge</a>, specifically to deal with nullifiers. Nullifiers would normally be immune to the damage from Blazing Pillage, but this augment removes their bubble forever. This augment is not needed, but makes the occasional nullifier much less threatening.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/grendel-chassis-build.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/grendel-chassis-build-1024x540.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-643"/></a><figcaption><em>Only augment mods work</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Melee Weapon &#8211; Fragor Prime</h3>



<p>Most weapons will feel very underwhelming with no mods. You won&#8217;t be able to equip Blood Rush, so combo counter stacking won&#8217;t do much. The most effective weapons are those with innate elements (especially toxin for bypassing shields), a helpful moveset, or strong base damage. </p>



<p>The weapon I used to deal with Bursas and other tanky enemies was Fragor Prime. Even unmodded, this weapon has a great slam attack that does decent damage and knocks down in a wide area.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Strategy &#8211; Spam Pillage</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Kill Them Quick While Healing Yourself</h3>



<p>Your main source of damage is augmented Pillage (#2). For this augment to deal damage, the enemy will need to be in range of Haven (#3). Pillage should give you more than enough shields back to spam it indefinitely, but you will need to be relatively close to the enemy to actually deal damage. Try to stack enemies up, jump into the middle of them, and spam Pillage.</p>



<p>Like most survival missions, try to kill enemies as fast as possible to generate life support. Unlike normal survival missions, you will likely need to use many of the supplied canisters, so don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re behind for using them.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/grendel-chassis-pillage.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/grendel-chassis-pillage.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-644"/></a><figcaption><em>Keep Haven up and spam Pillage</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Notable Enemies</h3>



<p>You will fight Bursas near the end. They can mostly be avoided, but they can be a nuisance. Use you Fragor to take the Bursas down, using Pillage to refill your shields as needed.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/grendel-neuroptics-bursas.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/grendel-neuroptics-bursas-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-676"/></a><figcaption><em>Fragor the Bursas</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Nullifier Crewman will stop your Pillage from dealing damage or giving you shields. Use a full charge shot from Balefire (#1) augmented with Balefire Surge. This will permanently break their nullify bubble, making the just normal crewmen. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/grendel-neuroptics-nullifier.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/grendel-neuroptics-nullifier-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-677"/></a><figcaption><em>Full charge augmented Balefire for nullifiers</em></figcaption></figure></div>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Unlocking the Mission</h2>



<p>The Mine of Karishh on Europa is one of the 3 Grendel missions and awards you the Grendel Systems blueprint. To unlock the Mine of Karishh mission, you will need to purchase a <em>Grendel Systems Locator </em>from the Arbitration Honor vendor in the Arbiters of Hexis room on any relay. This item will cost 25 Vitus Essence (obtainable through Arbitrations), but is not consumed until you complete the mission; you will be able to attempt the mission as many times as you would like until you get the reward for winning.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Build</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Warframe &#8211; Limbo</h3>



<p>This solo strategy relies on avoiding all combat and waiting for the excavators. With Limbo&#8217;s free access to the Rift Plane using dodge, the restrictions on mods and energy do not matter. You also will not need any augments for this strategy to work. Therefore, a no-mod Limbo is all you need.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/grendel-systems-build.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/grendel-systems-build-1024x406.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-664"/></a><figcaption><em>Just Limbo</em></figcaption></figure></div>

</script>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#663399;color:#663399"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Strategy &#8211; Wait in the Rift</h2>



<p>As soon as you zone into the mission, dodge with Limbo to enter the rift. This will make you immune to all damage from enemies. Despite this immunity, enemies will still try to attack you, allowing you to distract them.</p>



<p>When an excavator comes up, run to the waypoint to spawn it while still in the rift. Let 20 seconds pass until the excavator runs out of power, distracting enemies as necessary to ensure it lives.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/grendel-systems-rift.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/grendel-systems-rift-853x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-666"/></a><figcaption><em>Wait in the Rift</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Let the Excavators Die</h3>



<p>Once the excavator has run out of power, let it die. It will need to be gone for another excavator to spawn in that location. There is no limit on the number of excavators that will spawn, so don&#8217;t worry about running out. If no new excavators are spawning, encourage the enemies to destroy the existing ones.</p>



<p>Each excavator will give you 20 Cryotic with this strategy. This means that you will need 40 excavators to reach the 800 Cryotic you need. This will take a while, but is very safe and mostly AFK.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/grendel-systems-excavator.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/grendel-systems-excavator-1018x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-667"/></a><figcaption><em>20 Cryotic per Excavator, 40 Excavators</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Notable Enemies</h3>



<p>Nullifier bubbles can pull you out of the rift. They can be mostly avoided, but sometimes they will be in tight corridors, making them unavoidable. If you have to pass through a nullifier bubble, bullet jump through, and dodge again as soon as you get past it.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/grendel-systems-nullifier.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://marvweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/grendel-systems-nullifier-1024x931.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-668"/></a><figcaption><em>Stay in the Rift Whenever Possible</em></figcaption></figure></div>
